It requires that insurance companies get prior approval from the California Department of Insurance before boosting property and casualty rates.\n\u201cThe insurance industry has provided no evidence that the regulatory structure created by the voters is not working, or any justification for replacing it with the costly multi-tiered, new bureaucracy created by AB 2167 and its companion bill, SB 292,\u201d Consumer Watchdog\u2019s letter states.\nSenate Bill 292, authored by state Sen. Susan Rubio, D-Baldwin Park, establishes formulas to determine which counties are eligible for an \u201cinsurance market action plan,\u201d which would allow insurers to cut through some of the red tape involved in hiking rates.\nDaly said many insurers have re-evaluated their exposure to fire risk, and therefore, reduced the number of policies they provide in high-risk areas. That has resulted in a painful process for many homeowners, he said, who have had to seek coverage through other insurers, often paying more.\n\u201cToo many homeowners in California are suffering the consequences of insufficient competition in the insurance market,\u201d Daly said in a statement. \u201cThis bill will bring more insurers back to the\u00a0market and give consumers more options to choose from.\u201d\nDaly said it will help stop the cycle of non-renewals and ease the minds of homeowners who are afraid to open the mail.\nAB 2167, Consumer Watchdog\u2019s letter states, would allow insurance companies to raise homeowners\u2019 insurance rates at a time when they can least afford it.\nOrdinarily, the bill would be headed to a second policy committee in the Assembly since it\u2019s an amendment to Prop. 103, Rosenfield said, but the process of double-referring bills has stopped amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIf the legislation clears the Assembly floor it will go next to the Senate Insurance Committee.\n\u201cThe voters passed Prop. 103 because the state Legislature was beholden to the insurance industry,\u201d Rosenfield said. \u201cThirty years later the insurance industry is trying to buy its way out of what voters mandated.\u201d"},"2":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tCoronavirus rebound: Southern California pending home sales up for 6 straight weeks\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/06\/05\/coronavirus-rebound-socal-pending-home-sales-up-for-6-straight-weeks\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/SoCal-homebuying-rebounds-1.png?w=566","discription":"\nSouthern California house hunters signed 8% more sales contracts in late May, according to a tally by Zillow.\nA weekly report on activity from brokers\u2019 listing services in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties shows existing homes went into escrow at a weekly rate of 3,241 for the seven days ended May 30.

Gavin Newsom signed a May 6\u00a0executive order\u00a0extending protections for essential workers infected on the job on or after March 19, the day California\u2019s lockdown order went into effect. The order presumes that essential workers \u2014 including nurses, first responders, farmworkers and grocery workers who contracted COVID-19 \u2014 were infected on the job, and puts the burden on employers to prove otherwise.\nAt the same time, overall workers\u2019 compensation claims plummeted during California\u2019s lockdown as workplaces shut down and fewer employees were injured at work. Only 1,098 claims were filed in May, compared with more than 50,000 in January.\nWhile a number of states have extended similar \u201cpresumptive eligibility\u201d protections to varying groups of workers \u2013 mostly health care workers and first responders \u2013 California goes further than many in protecting all essential workers.\nLabor groups praised the executive order as protecting workers from a disease that can have severe and lingering effects, while the Chamber of Commerce and other business groups decried it as too expensive for the states\u2019 employers, many already reeling from the state lockdown and economic downturn.\nAs of Tuesday, more than 10,000 health care workers have been diagnosed with COVID-19; 63 have died. More than half worked in nursing homes.\nThe new claims data lands as the state\u2019s cases\u00a0climbed past 119,000\u00a0and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra joined 11 other state attorneys general Tuesday in a\u00a0letter calling on Walmart\u00a0to better protect its workers and the public from COVID-19. The retailer\u00a0has been criticized\u00a0for inadequate sick leave policies and failing to properly sanitize its stores.\nIt was not clear Wednesday whether Walmart employees in California have filed COVID-related workers comp claims; the state\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation agency does not make most individual claim details public.\nAnalysts originally estimated that California employers and their insurers might face COVID claims of up to $33.6 billion annually but later\u00a0downgraded that\u00a0to about $2 billion.\nCOVID-related claims were denied at a rate of 10 to 60 percent depending on the month. In April, about 13 percent of claims were denied. Under Newsom\u2019s executive order, essential workers, such as nurses or first responders, have to show that they were infected within a certain period after the statewide shutdown began; they also had to be diagnosed by a physician.\nGreg Gomez, a Sacramento-based attorney for the Ratto workers\u2019 compensation law firm, said the order has helped his client, a certified nurse assistant who believes he was infected after helping a resident in the senior home where he worked. The Sacramento worker\u2019s case has not yet been decided, Gomez said.\nThe order \u201cmade it a level playing field for people who contract COVID-19 at work,\u201d Gomez said, noting that it has traditionally been difficult for workers to prove they contracted a communicable disease at work rather than out in the community.\nGomez advised essential workers who think they were infected on the job to immediately report it to their employers should they choose to file a claim later. \u201cCOVID-19 is such a new disease that some effects\u00a0aren\u2019t known for weeks\u00a0afterwards,\u201d Gomez said.\nAlex Swedlow, president of the California Workers\u2019 Compensation Institute, a think tank largely funded by workers\u2019 comp insurers and self-insured employers, said that even before Newsom\u2019s order took effect, the majority of COVID claims were approved.\nThe shortage of diagnostic tests \u2014 a significant problem for workers in March and April, when most of the claims were filed \u2014 may have contributed to some of the denials, Swedlow said. Other workers may have been denied because they tested negative at a time when some COVID-19 tests\u00a0have produced false negatives.\nAn Institute\u00a0report\u00a0released earlier this month found that about 41 percent of workers\u2019 comp claims were made by health workers, with another 32 percent by first responders including police and firefighters. Some workers were denied because they worked at home; others because they declined to be tested, according to the report.\nSwedlow anticipates that denials may decline as workers get more access to testing and California\u2019s workers\u2019 comp system \u2013 created more than a century ago to deal with industrial injuries like broken bones \u2013\u00a0 adjusts to dealing with an entirely new disease.\nSteve Appell, who manages a workers\u2019 compensation law firm in Van Nuys and represents workers at their hearings, said that even employees whose COVID claims have been denied may get a second chance because of existing legal precedents.\n\u201cThese denials would probably be overturned should they go to court,\u201d Appell said."},"4":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tResidential tower proposed for Warner Center is facing appeals\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/06\/06\/residential-tower-proposed-for-warner-center-is-facing-appeals\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/LDN-L-TOWERS-0828-01-1.jpg?w=566","discription":"\nA project that proposed the construction of a 34-story apartment tower with 650 units is facing two appeals.\nThe project proposed for 6400 N.

This means incorporating thoughts, attitudes and behaviors that support a healthy financial life.\nThe same rings true for all other areas of our lives.\nThis spring has challenged us with devastating events that have completely upended the way we conduct our work, relationships and our lives. These events have asked us to flex and pivot mentally, emotionally, and physically in ways that few of us have ever been called to do.\nMany are experiencing what we would describe as an emotional shutdown. This is affecting the way we are able to go about our daily business and activities. When what is happening outside of us becomes too much for our own experience, we have a defense mechanism that protects us. This defense mechanism impels the mind to go into fight-or-flight mode. It\u2019s as if the mind says, \u201cEnough! I cannot assimilate all this at once. I am taking a brain break!\u201d\nThat\u2019s when we find it hard to focus or to think clearly. We may find it difficult to perform even the simplest of tasks. If you find yourself in such a state, it\u2019s time to take some steps for radical self-care so that you can lower stress and give your brain the space it deserves to regroup.\nHere are some basic steps to regain a personal sense of calm and control when the world seems to be falling apart.\nRoutines and rituals provide predictability, which lowers stress and gives us a sense of control. Heed to your normal rituals, such as how you make the bed and conduct your morning quiet time. This reinforces a sense of normalcy.\nKeep a regular schedule, whether with work or other activities.\nIdentify three things you want to accomplish each day and schedule them. Break down projects into bite-sized tasks and congratulate yourself on completing each step, one step at a time.\nAvoid judging yourself on what you aren\u2019t accomplishing. These are unusual times. Instead, delight in congratulating yourself on small wins. Practice self-compassion.\nInstead of telling yourself to \u201cget a stiff upper lip\u201d when things seem difficult, acknowledge that things are really difficult right now. Ask yourself how you can care and comfort yourself in these moments.\nIn short, treat yourself as you would (hopefully!) treat others in the same situation.\nWrite a handwritten note saying you are thinking about someone and send it to them. Make a phone call to see how others are doing. Order an anonymous grocery delivery to someone you know has lost their job or suffered financial hardship.\nWhile making a difference to others, this also reinforces to you the ability to make a difference. It also activates endorphins and good thoughts in you, helping to calm and regulate the nervous system.\nIf you obsess over the news and social media, you are feeding stress and anxiety. Avoid opening \u201cdoom and gloom\u201d YouTube videos and negative viral messages passed on by well-meaning friends and family members.\nAsk yourself what you responsibly need to know to keep up to date with current events, and then identify a dependable source for this. Decide to check this once daily. Balance this with sites that remind us that good things are happening in the world.\nTwo sources I enjoy are \u201cThe Good News Network\u201d website and John Krasinski\u2019s \u201cSome Good News\u201d on YouTube.\nThe way we are able to operate right now has been minimized and redirected. We can easily feel defeated. So many things we counted on in times past are no longer available to us. This can cause turmoil and frustration.\nBegin to identify the things you can control, and as you encounter limitations, congratulate yourself on learning any workarounds or other ways of accomplishing. Moving through this tumult requires that we flex and pivot.\nReplace phrases such as, \u201cI can\u2019t because\u2026\u201d with \u201cHow can I?\u201d or \u201cWhat else might I do instead?\u201d\nMoving away from undue stress and feelings of being overwhelmed to more focus and clarity requires practice. This requires that we intentionally take small steps in practice each day if we are to be successful.\nAs each of us asks ourselves how we should respond to current events, it will be important to show up as our best selves by cultivating the right mindset in order to make the greatest difference."},"6":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tCoronavirus rebound: SoCal housing jumps up from \u2018worst\u2019 April\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/06\/07\/coronavirus-rebound-socal-housing-jump-up-from-worst-april\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/California-home-purchase-loan-applications-2-1.png?w=566","discription":"\nThe region\u2019s housing markets are rebounding off what arguably was the worst April in the history books.\nWhen coronavirus-related \u201cstay at home\u201d orders began throttling the economy in March, house hunting dramatically slowed, and closing a deal became troublesome. It was the slowest April for sales in the six-county Southern California region \u2014 down 31% in a year \u2014 in CoreLogic\u2019s 32 years of recording real estate data.\nBut since mid-to-late April, as business limitations were eased, homebuying has perked up. Low mortgage rates, fewer house-hunting restrictions, and reinvigorated consumer confidence got owners to place more homes on the market and got house hunters in a buying mood.\nVarious metrics show a sharp bounce off recent lows leaving local homebuying close to the pace of 2019.\nMore Southern California house hunters are signing sales contracts.\nIn Los Angeles and Orange counties, pending sales \u2014 or escrows \u2014 of existing homes jumped sharply as of May 23, up 66.7% from a month ago \u2014 the fifth-largest gain among 27 big U.S. markets studied by Zillow\u2019s study of brokers\u2019 listings services.

Escrows are now down only 2.7% from last year.\nThe Inland Empire\u2019s new listings rose 12.5% in a month, but inventory is 29.6% below last year.\nCalifornians are applying for more home loans.\nIn the week of May 29, California applications ran 5.5% above the year-ago level, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. It\u2019s the first time above 2019\u2019s pace since March, and it\u2019s a stark change from the week ending April 10, when applications were 49% below a year ago.\nSince the recent bottom for mortgage-making, my trusty spreadsheet shows applications in California are running at a 67% faster pace than nine weeks ago. This push means homebuyers are seeking mortgages at a pace that\u2019s 93% of the first week of March.\nIn March, Emile Haddad, CEO of Five Point Holdings, said \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders pushed home sales at Irvine\u2019s high-profile Great Park Neighborhoods to zero.\nThe company\u2019s project on the long-shuttered airbase had 553 sales last year \u2014 that\u2019s almost 11 a week \u2014 and in 2020\u2019s first 11 weeks, builders on Five Point land had made sales contracts at a nearly 14-a-week pace.\nBut in mid-March, Haddad said he saw an economy put into an \u201cinduced coma\u201d for its well-being: \u201cOnce the patient awakes, they should be healthy.\u201d\nOver five weeks, Great Park sales slumped to a total net loss of three sales. Then, almost as suddenly as sales slowed, buying rebounded as the economy\u2019s reopening slowly began. In the next six weeks, 45 sales contracts were signed.\n\u201cIt feels like now we\u2019re back normal velocity,\u201d Haddad says.\nNow, the CEO isn\u2019t ready to say the real estate market is fully back to normal. He needs even more strong weeks of sales to lower his concerns. The year-to-date sales pace, thanks to the virus, is still off 18% from 2019.\n\u201cIt is early in the post-COVID-19 period to feel like there is any solid trend line in terms of home sales,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good start, but if there is a second or third wave of the virus this could change again.\u201d\nA shaky economy hasn\u2019t stopped local house hunters from paying up.\nSoCal home prices were slowly rising as the pandemic took hold of the economy.\nCoreLogic\u2019s Home Price Index, based on closed sales of single-family homes, showed the biggest percentage gains of the year in April. House prices increased at a 4.9% annual rate in Los Angeles County, 3.7% in Orange County, and 5% in the Inland Empire.\nAnd prices of homes going into escrow are up, too.\nA thin supply of housing options pushed the LA-OC median listing price to $890,040, according to Zillow. That\u2019s up 3.7% in a month, and up 6.8% in a year, the third-largest 12-month gain among 35 markets tracked.\nThe Inland Empire\u2019s status as the region\u2019s spot for housing bargain hunters likely aided its sales recovery.

But the government made the same mistakes in April, and together the figures still show the job market is improving.\nThe May job gain, which confounded economists\u2019 expectations of another round of severe losses, suggests that thousands of stores, restaurants, gyms and other companies reopened and rehired more quickly than many analysts had forecast.\nStocks surged on Wall Street on the news, with the S&P 500 gaining 2.2% within 15 minutes.\n\u201cWe are witnessing the easiest phase of growth as people come off temporary layoffs and come back to their employers,\u201d said Harvard University economist Jason Furman, who led the White House Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama presidency. \u201cAnd once employers are done recalling people, the much harder, longer work of recovery will have to proceed.\u201d\nMost economists expected rehiring to kick in as shutdowns were increasingly lifted and people gradually resumed shopping and eating out.\n\u201cThe surprising thing here is the timing and that it happened as quickly as it did,\u201d said Adam Kamins, senior regional economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.\nEconomists had expected the government to report that employers shed 8.5 million more jobs last month on top of 21.4 million lost in March and April.\nInstead, nearly all industries added jobs, a sharp reversal from April, when almost all cut them. Hotels and restaurants added 1.2 million jobs in May, after shedding 7.5 million. Retailers gained 368,000, after losing nearly 2.3 million in the previous month. Construction companies added 464,000 after cutting 995,000.\nThe unemployment rate is still at its highest level since the 1930s era of bread lines and soup kitchens.\nFriday\u2019s figures raise a key question for businesses and unemployed workers: How fast will the rebound proceed? For hiring to continue at a solid pace, businesses will probably need to see signs that consumers are starting to resume their pre-outbreak habits of shopping and dining out.\nThe crisis has also exposed wide disparities: While the unemployment rate for white Americans was 12.4% May, it was 17.6% for Hispanics and 16.8% for African-Americans.\nEven with the surprising gain in May, it may take months for all those who lost work in April and March to find jobs. Some economists forecast the rate could remain in double-digits through the November elections and into next year.\nThe street protests over George Floyd\u2019s killing that led to vandalism and looting in dozens of cities did not affect Friday\u2019s figures, which were compiled in the middle of May. But business closings related to the unrest could show up in the June report.\nA few businesses are reporting signs of progress even in hard-hit industries. American Airlines, for example, said this week that it will fly 55% of its U.S. routes in July, up from just 20% in May.\nAnd the Cheesecake Factory said one-quarter of its nearly 300 restaurants have reopened, though with limited capacity. Sales are at nearly 75% of the levels reached a year ago, the company said.\nFriday\u2019s report made it clear the government continues to struggle with how it classifies millions of workers on temporary layoff. The Labor Department admitted that government household survey-takers mistakenly counted about 4.9 million temporarily laid-off people as employed.\nThe government doesn\u2019t correct its survey results for fear of the appearance of political manipulation.\nHad the mistake been corrected, the unemployment rate would have risen to 16.1% in May. But the corrected April figure would have been more than than 19%, rather than 14.7%.\nErica Groshen, a labor economist at Cornell University and a former commissioner of the Labor Department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics, said hiring could ramp up relatively quickly in the coming months and reduce unemployment to low double-digits by year\u2019s end.\n\u201cThen my inclination is that it will be a long, slow slog,\u201d she said.\nUntil most Americans are confident they can shop, travel, eat out and fully return to their other spending habits without fear of contracting the virus, the economy is likely to remain sluggish.\nGwyneth Duesbery, 22, returned this week to her job as a restaurant hostess in Grand Rapids, Michigan, as Bowdie\u2019s Chop House prepares to reopen with tables 6 feet apart and seating capacity reduced to about one-quarter.\n\u201cI am concerned that it will expose me to potential diseases, and expose others, no matter the precautions that we take,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of uncharted waters.\u201d\n\u00a0"},"8":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tHousing advocates breathe sigh of relief after California\u2019s coronavirus budget cuts\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/05\/19\/housing-advocates-breathe-sigh-of-relief-after-californias-coronavirus-budget-cuts\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/SJM-L-GAVIN-0507-1-2.jpg?w=525","discription":"\nAfter Gov.

No, it won\u2019t be enough.

Unemployment could near 20%. And potentially fewer than half of all adults may be working.\nBeneath the dismal figures will be signs that job cuts, severe as they are, are slowing as more businesses gradually or partially reopen. Still, the economy is mired in a recession, and any rebound in hiring will likely be painfully slow. Economists foresee unemployment remaining in double-digits through the November elections and into 2021.\nIf their forecast of 8 million jobs lost in May proves correct, it would come on top of April\u2019s loss of 20.5 million jobs \u2014 the worst monthly loss on record \u2014 and bring total job cuts in the three months since the viral outbreak intensified to nearly 30 million. That\u2019s more than three times the jobs lost in the 2008-2009 Great Recession. And if the jobless rate does reach 20% for May, it would be double the worst level during that previous recession.\nOverhanging the jobs picture is widespread uncertainty about how long the unemployed will remain out of work. Most of the layoffs in recent months were a direct result of the sudden shutdowns of businesses in response to the coronavirus pandemic. As many of these businesses reopen, at least partially, workers who had been laid off have held out hope of being rehired soon.\nBut some small employers might not reopen at all if the recession drags on much longer. And even once companies do reopen, their business may not fully return until Americans are confident they can shop, eat out and return to other previous habits without becoming sick. For now, most people who have lost jobs still say they expect their unemployment to prove temporary.\nEven if just one-third of the job losses turn out to be permanent, though, that would leave 10 million people who will need to find work at new employers or even in new occupations. That is still more than all the jobs lost in the Great Recession.\nA hole that size would take years to fill. Hiring will likely rebound over the summer and fall as states and cities further lift restrictions on economic activity. But it won\u2019t match the huge job cuts this spring. Oxford Economics, a consulting firm, estimates that the economy will regain 17 million jobs by year\u2019s end, a huge increase by historic standards. But that would make up for barely more than half the losses.\nSeth Carpenter, an economist at UBS, said that after an initial bounce-back, future hiring will likely be slow and could be interrupted by another wave of the pandemic.\nAdam Ozimek, chief economist at Upwork, notes the fastest year for job growth since the Great Recession was 3 million jobs in 2014. Even at that pace, it would take at least several years to return to the pre-pandemic job market.\nSince mid-March, more than 40 million Americans have applied for unemployment benefits. That doesn\u2019t mean that many people are still unemployed. The figure likely includes some duplicate filings: In some states, self-employed and \u201cgig\u201d workers applied under their regular state unemployment systems before they were able to file under a new federal program that has made them eligible for benefits for the first time.\nIn addition, some people who lost jobs early and applied for unemployment aid have been rehired. That, along with slowing layoffs, helps explain why the net job loss for May is expected to be far less than April\u2019s. Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 3 million people who were initially laid off have already been rehired.\nWeekly surveys of small businesses by the Census Bureau show an uptick in the number of such companies that are hiring and providing more hours of work, though the gains are slight. In mid-May, the most recent data available, nearly 10% of small companies surveyed said they had added jobs in the past week, and 12% said they had added hours. Both figures were roughly double their level three weeks earlier.\nStill, 16% said they had cut jobs, and a third said they were still cutting hours \u2014 figures that are consistent with ongoing but smaller job cuts in May.\nThree-quarters of states have allowed dining-in services to resume at restaurants, though most are still restricting total capacity. Many states have reopened gyms, hair salons and movie theaters. But a meaningful rebound will require greater public willingness to return to their old activities without fear of contracting the virus.\nAdam Kamins, senior regional economist at Moodys Analytics, said this probably won\u2019t happen until a vaccine is available or testing expands significantly.\nCivil unrest in dozens of cities since the weekend in response to the killing in Minneapolis of George Floyd may also weigh on the economy in the short term, though analysts for now expect the consequences to be limited. Kamins said the economic damage was likely mitigated by the fact that so much activity is still closed down in large cities like New York and Washington, with many people already working from home.\nData from the restaurant reservation app OpenTable showed a slight drop in dine-in activity Monday and Tuesday that might have been caused by the protests.\n\u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t help to have this layer of uncertainty added on,\u201d Kamins said.\nHeidi Shierholz, senior economist at the progressive Economic Policy Institute and a former chief economist at the Labor Department, suggested that more government aid will be necessary to keep consumers and businesses afloat so that many laid-off workers will have jobs to return to.\n\u201cThose jobs are not going to come back if the federal government doesn\u2019t do the things it needs to do to stimulate the economy, so that the demand and confidence is going to be there, so that those businesses will need to call workers back,\u201d Shierholz said."}}
