We are trying to end it,\u201d \u201cSay his name. George Floyd,\u201d \u2014 and chanting \u201cNo justice. No peace. No racist police,\u201d and \u201cBlack lives matter.\u201d\nThe gathering started peaceful, as about 500 people turned out at the intersection of Foothill and Day Creek boulevards to protest police violence and to support the Black Lives Matter movement.\nBut tension rose a few hours later, when deputies warned protesters to disperse or they would be arrested. There were 13 arrests as of 11:30 p.m., but it was still an active scene, said Deputy Olivia Bozek, a spokeswoman for the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\nThe charges against those arrested were not immediately known.\nAs night grew near, the protest began to grow more tense. People began to trickle onto city streets. Some threw water bottles at Sheriff\u2019s Department vehicles driving by the crowd. The vehicles drove away.\nVehicles honked to show their support while passing through the intersection.\nAt about 7 p.m., Bozek said that the protest had been peaceful.\nShortly after, the water bottles had been thrown, and a Sheriff\u2019s Department helicopter circling overhead told the crowd to disperse, but the protesters remained.\nDeputies wearing riot gear and protesters were face-to-face by 8 p.m. on Foothill Boulevard, west of Day Creek. The crowd had begun to dissipate and fewer than 100 protesters remained. The chants continued, but a deputy warned the remainder of the crowd to disperse.\n\u201cIf you do not immediately disperse, you will be arrested,\u201d he told protesters.\nBy 10:45 p.m., the area had emptied out.\nIn Fontana on Thursday, the nine people were arrested when protesters began throwing rocks at businesses, cars and officers, according to police. Officers used foam rounds and tear gas, police said, and the protest cleared up at around midnight."},"2":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tValley church leaders say they support protests, demand justice for George Floyd\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/05\/29\/valley-church-leaders-say-they-support-protests-demand-justice-for-george-floyd\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/LDN-L-PROTEST-RESEDA-0530-02-SR-1-1.jpg?w=526","discription":"\nJames Thomas, professor at Cal State LA and a Black Lives Matter member, speaks during a press conference denouncing the death of George Floyd while in police custody and the fragile state of racial relations in the San Fernando Valley outside the Reseda Church of Christ on Friday, May 29, 2020.

Several speakers denounced any non-peaceful actions by protesters.\nThe Valley is far from immune from fraught relations between police and the black community, Winrow noted, highlighting two cases of police involved killings of black men who belonged to his church including James Mincey Jr. who died in 1982 by police chokehold.\nSince the video of Floyd\u2019s death circulated widely, Minneapolis has seen days of growing unrest in recent days that escalated in the burning of a police station Thursday. Similar protests have \nFloyd\u2019s death also came amid outrage over the death of Ahmaud Arbery, who was fatally shot Feb. 23 in Georgia after a white father and son pursued the 25-year-old black man they had spotted running in their subdivision.

We need to roll up our sleeves and put policies in place that truly deal with the systemic issues of racism.\u201d\nRep. Tony Cardenas, D-Panorama City,\u00a0 echoed the need to push back against institutional racism in the context of his personal experiences, pointing to discrimination he faced as a young Latino man from authority figures like teachers and police.\n\u201cI live a blessed life.

In Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and beyond, thousands of protesters carried signs that said: \u201cHe said I can\u2019t breathe. Justice for George.\u201d They chanted \u201c\u201dNo justice, no peace\u201d and \u201cSay his name. George Floyd.\u201d\nAfter hours of peaceful protest in downtown Atlanta, some demonstrators suddenly turned violent, smashing police cars, setting one on fire, spray-painting the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters, and breaking into a restaurant. The crowd pelted officers with bottles, chanting \u201cQuit your jobs.\u201d\nAt least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said. Campos said protesters shot BB guns at officers and threw bricks, bottles and knives at them. People watched the scene from rooftops, some laughing as skirmishes broke out.\nMayor Keisha Lance Bottoms passionately addressed the protesters at a news conference: \u201cThis is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr.\u201d\n\u201cYou are disgracing our city,\u201d she told protesters. \u201cYou are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country. We are better than this. We are better than this as a city. We are better than this as a country. Go home, go home.\u201d\nBottoms was flanked by rappers T.I. and Killer Mike, as well as King\u2019s daughter, Bernice King.\nKiller Mike cried as he spoke.\n\u201cWe have to be better than this moment. We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?\u201d he said.\nAfter Mayor Bottoms appealed for calm, the violence continued. More cars were set on fire, a Starbucks was smashed up, the windows of the College Football Hall of Fame were broken, and the iconic Omni Hotel was vandalized.\nProtesters gathered outside the White House, with President Donald Trump inside, and some tried to push through barriers set up by the U.S. Secret Service along Pennsylvania Avenue.\nIn Minneapolis, a curfew did little to stop protesters and others from gathering in several areas of the city, including the battered Lake Street neighborhood where a police precinct was burned the night before. There were scattered small fires and some stores in a strip mall were being broken into near the city\u2019s 5th Precinct.\nAn initially peaceful demonstration in New York City spiraled into chaos as night fell, as protesters skirmished with officers, destroyed police vehicles and set fires.\nIn Brooklyn, activists who had marched from Manhattan chanted insults at officers lined up outside the Barclays Center and pelted them with water bottles. Police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical into the largely diverse crowd multiple times, then cleared the plaza.\nVideo posted to social media showed officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets.\nDemonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, then scrawled graffiti across its charred hulk and set it on fire a second time as officers retreated from the area. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle.\nNumerous people were arrested and police brought in buses to carry off those they arrested.\n\u201cWe have a long night ahead of us in Brooklyn,\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted. \u201cOur sole focus is deescalating this situation and getting people home safe. There will be a full review of what happened tonight. We don\u2019t ever want to see another night like this.\u201d\nThe police department said numerous officers were injured, including one who had a tooth knocked out.\nThe names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs carried by those in the crowd, and in their chants.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my duty to be out here,\u201d said Brianna Petrisko, among those at Foley Square in lower Manhattan, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cOur country has a sickness. We have to be out here. This is the only way we\u2019re going to be heard.\u201d\nIn Houston, where George Floyd grew up, several thousand people rallied in front of City Hall. Among them was 19-year-old Jimmy Ohaz, who came from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas.\n\u201cMy question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we\u2019re not oppressed.\u201d\nTensions rose in several West Coast cities as night fell.\nAbout 1,000 protesters gathered in Oakland at a demonstration billed on social media as a rally to \u201cF(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk) the police,\u201d and some windows were smashed.\nDemonstrators shut down a freeway in Los Angeles amid isolated scuffles with police that ended in a few protesters detained and one officer receiving medical treatment, police said. An LAPD vehicle had its windows smashed, and CNN reported that someone wrote \u201ckiller\u201d on a patrol car.\nProtesters repeatedly clashed with police in the Silicon Valley city of San Jose, said Mayor Sam Liccardo, and police responded with flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets. One officer was being treated at a hospital for an injury that was not life-threatening, he and police officials said.\nLiccardo said his own officers shared the community\u2019s outrage over Floyd\u2019s in-custody death.\n\u201cIt was a horrible injustice. I\u2019d venture to guess that every police officer out there feels much of the same anger about what happened in Minneapolis,\u201d he told The Associated Press.\nThirty miles to the west, Santa Cruz police chief Andrew G.

We\u2019re trying to capture best we can not only the senior experience, but the freshman experience, the sophomore experience, the junior experience.\n\u201cWe want to truly represent our entire student body\u2019s experience with events that happened during the school year.\u201d\nAs the main editor of the yearbook for Aquinas High School in San Bernardino, senior Sara Duran was responsible for about 75% of what can now be considered a time capsule to a pre-coronavirus, pre-COVID-19 world.\nWith hard deadlines throughout the school year, yearbook advisers and student editors like Duran dole out assignments so major seasonal activities such as dances, pep rallies and sporting events are covered. Similarly, senior portraits have to be handed in by a certain date, while prom, grad night and other year-end celebrations typically fall casualty to March and April deadlines.\n\u201cWe learned this year,\u201d Duran said, \u201cthat time is very precious.\u201d\nServite High School yearbook advisers Jen Emard and Andrea Watanabe have cultivated a classroom environment that bears a resemblance to a Fortune 500 company, with the two women serving as chief executive officers overseeing a major business project.\nYearbook students at the all-boys Catholic school in Anaheim learn the basics of project management, the two said, and are encouraged throughout the school year to reflect on what went right, what went wrong and what could be done better next time.\nAbove all, Emard and Watanabe said, kids have to take ownership of their projects to truly appreciate the process.\n\u201cYearbook is a real neat way to be connected to all aspects of the school,\u201d Emard said. \u201cOur kids are taking photos at sporting events, robotics competitions, theater. I don\u2019t know any elective at Servite that puts kids in every classroom \u2013 English, math, history \u2013 and gives them the opportunity to interview teachers and students throughout the year.\u201d\nWith the exception of a few pages for spring sports and activities, most pages in most yearbooks were complete when the coronavirus crisis \nHowever, work still remained.\nDuran, 17, and a few of her Aquinas classmates met virtually with students and teachers to go over and finish assignments. Schmidt, meanwhile, used Chaparral\u2019s Blackboard communication tool to solicit student photos for the \u201cStudent life\u201d spread and Emard and Watanabe said they had to reconfigure certain pages at the tail end of the yearbook to make up for lost content.\n\u201cOur yearbook kids and their adviser worked so tremendously hard,\u201d Rialto High principal Caroline Sweeney said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in this yearbook that looks rushed or hurried. It looks like it has the same pride as every other year. Our yearbook kids just made it work because they were so committed to it being a good product.\n\u201cThey knew it was going to be history,\u201d Sweeney added. \u201cThis yearbook will be the pandemic yearbook, it will.\u201d\nWorking on deadline under such extreme conditions, Duran said, \u201cgot my creative juices flowing. I had to think hard about different pages and how I wanted them to look, what colors to use, how photos go with each other. These moments would be memories for students and I was able to make these memories last through the yearbook.\n\u201cI had a lot of pride after finishing this.\u201d\nAside from a sentence or two explaining why certain springtime pages were barer than usual, precious little ink in most 2019-20 yearbooks was spilled on the coronavirus pandemic or the subsequent school closures and statewide lockdowns.\nHowever, as relatively little impact as the virus had on completing these keepsakes, how and when they will be distributed to students amid the current public health crisis has changed entirely.\nYearbook students at Rialto High, for example, traditionally plan distribution parties during lunches to toast the year that was with ice cream, music and opportunities for friends to sign pages. Due to public health concerns, however, yearbooks are expected to be passed out safely on campus at a later date, with school officials brainstorming ways to celebrate the moment.\n\u201cOur kids want the memory of this year,\u201d said Sweeney, noting that Rialto High is close to selling out of yearbooks for the first time. \u201cTo me, (the yearbook) is one of our largest sources of pride. These are truly going to create one of the lasting memories for us.\u201d\nAll Chaparral High yearbooks close with a note from one of the class\u2019 editors.\nThis year, Schmidt\u2019s graduating son, Jacob, had the honor.\nWhile most students will not see his message, or even know it is there, until they have a moment to sit down and thumb through the moments forever memorialized inside, Jacob Schmidt\u2019s message of perseverance in these trying times quite literally closes the book on the most upside-down school year of all.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of our kids, and I\u2019m excited for our student body to get this,\u201d Jackie Schmidt said. \u201cWe had a good year. It ended in something we couldn\u2019t control, but this yearbook I truly believe is going to bring back super positive experiences. Students will be able to look back and remember that the last nine weeks were rough, but the first 27 were pretty fantastic.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all grown this year and our yearbook will capture that.\u201d"},"8":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tAs shutdowns lifts, what happens when wildlife exploring urban areas mix with humans return?\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/05\/29\/as-shutdowns-lifts-what-happens-when-wildlife-exploring-urban-areas-mix-with-humans-return\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/OCR-L-HBCOYOTE-0529-02-01-1.jpg?w=615","discription":"\nIt was an shocking sight as Huntington Beach resident Bob Daniel drove up Main Street after an early morning shooting video at the beach: A coyote strolling casually in downtown, an area typically busy with tourists and beachgoers just a few blocks from the Pacific Ocean.\nDaniel caught the moment on Wednesday, May 27, on camera as the coyote trotted past a stop sign, just across from Surf City Ale House.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen plenty of coyotes here in H.B., but never one downtown,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was unusual.\u201d\nAs people have stayed home in recent months amid the coronavirus pandemic, wildlife has been exploring empty streets usually bustling with people. Reports of coyotes, in particular, have been spotted in once-popular streets of San Francisco to Chicago and beyond.\nBut as restrictions loosen up and more people are going outside, what will happen when the wildlife starts to mix with human\u2019s return?\n\u201cThere\u2019s not any more of the critters, but they are changing their behaviors,\u201d said Eric Strauss, president\u2019s professor of biology for Loyola Marymount University\u2019s Center for Urban Resilience. \u201cThe wildlife in urban areas are always adjusting their behavior based on ours.\u201d\nUrban wildlife, like coyotes, have become dependent on humans for food, finding scraps on the streets in the darkness or early morning hours, while most people sleep.\nDuring the coronavirus shutdown, \u201cthe abundant food resource got shut off in a matter of days. It changed the foraging dynamics, the risk analysis of what they should take in respect to searching for food,\u201d Strauss said.\nAs people stayed indoors, our \u201ccenter spots\u201d were less used, allowing wildlife to expand their radius.\n\u201cIn almost every city, you\u2019re reading some story about them walking in some area that had been historically dominated by humans,\u201d Strauss said. \u201cThere\u2019s no people, and there\u2019s not as much food, so they are taking longer to search for food.\n\u201cAs we withdraw, more habitat becomes available for them to search for food,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they are showing up, there\u2019s no people and no food. It takes longer to check out before they give up and go somewhere else.\u201d\nPlus, people are at home looking out of their windows when they would otherwise be in offices focused instead on work and other distractions, Strauss noted.\nWhat we\u2019re seeing during the coronavirus pandemic is \u201chabitat fragmentation.\u201d\n\u201cWhen we back off a bit, we see them move into the new areas,\u201d he said.\nWhen we move back outside, they will likely move away.\n\u201cSome coyotes are getting bolder,\u201d he said.\nIn Laguna Beach recently, authorities have been on the hunt for a coyote that bit a 91-year-old man who was picking up his newspaper in the driveway. Authorities \nRelocating a problem coyote is not an option because it only moves the problem to another neighborhood, California Department of Fish and Wildlife authorities say.\nStrauss and his students are working on a project that uses about 30 remote cameras set around Culver City, recording when movement, whether it be human or wildlife, is sensed. Thousands of photos are being generated a week, showing the exact time and place creatures are detected without interfering with their behavior.\n\u201cWhat is their temporal use of land before the pandemic, through it and after?\u201d Strauss wonders. \u201cIt will be very interesting to see.\n\u201cI think what we are going to see we can tie into exact human events.\u201d\nThe Huntington Beach coyote seemed to just be out for a stroll, as it trotted across Main Street and Olive Avenue, chasing a squirrel under a car, Daniel said.\n\u201cHe went around to the other side,\u201d Daniel said, \u201cand the squirrel got up a tree before the coyote could get breakfast.\u201d"},"9":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tLAX, Van Nuys airports braced for economic turbulence ahead\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/05\/01\/lax-van-nuys-airports-braced-for-economic-turbulence-ahead\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/TDB-L-VIRUS-LAX-UPDATE-0325_33-1.jpg?w=525","discription":"\nThe financial outlook for Los Angeles World Airports remains gloomy, with a budget forecast for next year providing scenarios in which its revenues will continue to decline due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCommercial air traffic continues to be down about 95% compared to prior years at Los Angeles International Airport, according to Sean Burton, president of the Board of Airport Commissioners.\nLAWA, the umbrella of LAX and Van Nuys Airport, reported an average of 1,900 flights a day normally take place this time of year, but they\u2019re down to about 400, and most of those are flights that ship cargo.\n\u201cEven if we don\u2019t end up planning for the worst-case scenario, the cuts will be deeper,\u201d said Tatiana Starostina, LAWA chief financial officer, adding that while the budget cuts have been \u201cvery painful\u201d to make, airport officials are working under economic uncertainty.\nStarostina presented two possible scenarios for air traffic in the near future, one that showed air traffic increasing steadily by December and then leveling off for the remainder of the fiscal year but still below traffic levels of early March. The second scenario showed almost no growth in air traffic until September and then steadily increasing by next summer.\nIn the first scenario, airport revenue next year would decline 15% compared to last year while expenses would also decline 10%. The second scenario showed the airport\u2019s revenue declining 24% next year while expenses would remain the same.\nThis amounted to a projected revenue loss of about $239 million in the first scenario and about $376 million in the second.\nIt\u2019s uncertain what kind of additional debt the airports could incur in the next year, as new contracts and construction projects are currently not being considered, but construction continues to take place throughout the airport facilities, Starostina said.\nThe end of this fiscal year is projected to see a about a 31% decline in total passengers compared to last fiscal year, Starostina said.\nThe budget proposals, however, did not account for money coming to LAX via the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, which allocated $326 million to LAX to mitigate its pandemic-related losses.\nTask forces working within LAWA have been addressing safety measures and ways to clean airport facilities, according to Justin Erbacci, interim CEO of LAWA.\n\u201cNow our focus is on recovery,\u201d Erbacci said. \u201cThere are many new things that we need to look at to try to see how we are going to get ourselves out of this current crisis. Internationally, there\u2019s just not a lot of activity right now.\u201d\nCutting additional costs may be the only way to do that, Burton said.\n\u201cObviously, these are projections. We don\u2019t have control over the revenue side of this,\u201d Burton said. \u201cWe have more control over the expense side of this. \u2026 To go down 24% in revenues and only 10% in expenses, that won\u2019t work in the long run.\u201d\nThe board has already revised agreements for airlines and commercial tenants at the airport to help them maintain business as well. The board also took action in March to put a stop on all new hiring until the pandemic measures are lifted.\nCommissioners said the board may need to starting figuring how to \u201cmake real sacrifices\u201d in terms of contracts and expenditures it thought it would need in the next fiscal year.\nThe next Board of Airport Commissioners meeting, its first in May, will consist of a \u201cdeep dive\u201d into budget details, LAWA officials said. The second meeting of the month will include commissioners\u2019 feedback on the budget proposals and present finalized projected revenue and expenses.\nThe first meeting in June will be the presentation of the LAWA draft budget, which needs to be finalized by June 30."},"10":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tClint Eastwood is turning 90, here\u2019s some trivia to make your day\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/05\/29\/clint-eastwood-is-turning-90-heres-some-trivia-to-make-your-day\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/web-clint-1.jpg?w=567","discription":"\nLegendary Hollywood star Clint Eastwood turns 90 on Sunday.

Freeman did not provide immediate details, but said a criminal complaint would be made available later Friday and that more charges were possible.\nIn the video, Chauvin is seen kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck as Floyd is on the ground. He gradually becomes motionless as Chauvin and three other officers ignore bystanders\u2019 shouts to get off him. Freeman said the investigation continues into the other three officers, but that authorities \u201cfelt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.\u201d\nFreeman highlighted the \u201cextraordinary speed\u201d in charging the case just four days after Floyd\u2019s death, but also defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. He said his office needed time to put together evidence, including what he called the \u201chorrible\u201d video by a bystander. He said he would not bring a case unless he had enough evidence to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.\nProtests in Minneapolis escalated in violence on Thursday, when demonstrators torched a police station that officers had abandoned.\n\u201cI\u2019m not insensitive to what happened in the streets,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cMy own home has been picketed regularly.\u201d\nNews of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the \u201cabject failure\u201d of the response to the protests and called for swift justice for officers involved. Walz said the state would take over the response to the violence and that it\u2019s time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering.\n\u201cMinneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,\u201d Walz said, adding. \u201cNow generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world \u2014 and the world is watching.\u201d\nThe governor cited a call he received from a state senator who described her district \u201con fire, no police, no firefighters, no social control, constituents locked in houses wondering what they were going to do. That is an abject failure that cannot happen.\u201d\nHis comments came the morning after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts,\u201d which prompted a warning from Twitter for \u201cglorifying violence.\u201d\nThe governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard\u2019s mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources \u201cnever came,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,\u201d Walz said.\nOn Friday morning, nearly every building in the shopping district around the abandoned police station had been vandalized, burned or looted. National Guard members were in the area, with several of them lined up, keeping people away from the police station.\nDozens of volunteers swept up broken glass in the street, doing what they could to help.\nDean Hanson, 64, lives in a subsidized housing unit nearby, which is home to many older residents. He said his building lost electricity overnight, and residents were terrified as they watched mobs of people run around their neighborhood, with no apparent intervention.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening here,\u201d he said.\nDozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd\u2019s death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver.\nTrump threatened to bring Minneapolis \u201cunder control,\u201d calling the protesters \u201cthugs\u201d and tweeting that \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d The tweet\u00a0drew another warning\u00a0from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform\u2019s rules, but the company did not remove it.\nTrump also blasted the \u201ctotal lack of leadership\u201d in Minneapolis.\nA visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan here?\u201d\n\u201cWith regard to?\u201d Frey responded. Then he added: \u201cThere is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that \u2026 What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.\u201d\nHe defended the city\u2019s lack of engagement with looters \u2014 only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence \u2014 and said, \u201cWe are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.\u201d He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies.\nThe Minnesota State Patrol\u00a0arrested a CNN television crew\u00a0early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs.\nThe Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were \u201cclearing the streets and restoring order,\u201d and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were \u201ca clear violation of their First Amendment rights.\u201d Walz publicly apologized on Friday.\nAttorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing members of Floyd\u2019s family, called for an independent investigation, and said he asked to take custody of Floyd\u2019s body to have an independent autopsy performed. Floyd said that talk of a heart condition or asthma is irrelevant because Floyd was walking and breathing before his contact with police.\nThe doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City, who was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner as well.\nIn New York City, protesters defied New York\u2019s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and\u00a0downtown Columbus.\u00a0A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis.\nAbout 10 protesters went to a Florida home believed to belong to Chauvin. The Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Office tweeted Friday that Chauvin was not at the residence and has no plans to be in the area.\nIn Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was\u00a0fatally shot by police\u00a0in her home in March.\nIn Mississippi, the mayor of the community of Petal\u00a0resisted calls to resign\u00a0following his remarks about Floyd\u2019s death. Hal Marx, a Republican, asked on Twitter: \u201cWhy in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?\u201d In a follow-up tweet, he said he \u201cdidn\u2019t see anything unreasonable.\u201d\nThe city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as \u201cawfully drunk\u201d and said he was \u201cnot in control of himself.\u201d\nAsked by the 911 operator whether the man was \u201cunder the influence of something,\u201d the caller said: \u201cSomething like that, yes. He is not acting right.\u201d Police said Floyd matched the caller\u2019s description of the suspect.\nState and federal authorities are investigating Floyd\u2019s death.\nChauvin, the\u00a0officer who knelt\u00a0on Floyd\u2019s neck, was fired Tuesday, along with three other officers involved in the arrest.\nThe owner of a popular Latin nightclub said that Floyd and Chauvin both worked as security guards at the club as recently as the end of last year, but it\u2019s not clear whether they worked together. Chauvin worked at the El Nuevo Rodeo club as an off-duty security guard for nearly two decades, but Floyd had only worked there more recently for about a dozen events that featured African-American music, Maya Santamaria told The Associated Press.\nSantamaria said if Chauvin had recognized Floyd, \u201che might have given him a little more mercy.\u201d\nSantamaria, who sold the venue within the past two months, said Chauvin got along well with the regular Latino customers, but did not like to work the African American nights. When he did, and there was a fight, he would spray people with mace and call for police backup and half-dozen squad cars would soon show up, something she felt was unjustified \u201coverkill.\u201d\n___"},"12":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tChinese lawmakers endorse Hong Kong national security law\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/05\/28\/chinese-lawmakers-endorse-hong-kong-national-security-law\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/China_Congress_13601-1.jpg?w=525","discription":"\nBy JOE McDONALD\nBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s legislature endorsed a national security law for Hong Kong on Thursday that has strained relations with the United States and Britain and prompted new protests in the territory.\nThe National People\u2019s Congress approved the bill as it wrapped up an annual session that was held under intensive anti-coronavirus controls. The vote was 2,878-1 with six abstentions, in line with the high-profile but largely ceremonial body\u2019s custom of near-unanimous support for all legal changes decided by the ruling Communist Party.\nThe law will alter Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution, or Basic Law, to require the territory to enforce measures to be decided by the NPC\u2019s standing committee, a small body controlled by the ruling party that handles most lawmaking work.\nThe law reflects the determination of President Xi Jinping\u2019s government to tighten control over Hong Kong following 11 months of anti-government protests. Activists in Hong Kong say the law will undermine the \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d promised to the former British colony when it was handed back to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework and might be used to suppress political activity.\nPremier Li Keqiang, the country\u2019s No. 2 leader, defended the law as consistent with Beijing\u2019s promises.\n\u201cThe decision adopted by the NPC session is designed for steady implementation of \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 and Hong Kong\u2019s long-term prosperity and stability,\u201d Li said at a news conference.\nThe law and the way it is being enacted prompted U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday to announce Washington will no longer treat Hong Kong as autonomous from Beijing. That could hurt the territory\u2019s attractiveness as a business center.\nPompeo\u2019s notice adds Hong Kong to the Trump administration\u2019s conflicts with China over trade, technology, religious freedom, Chinese handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the status of Taiwan, the self-ruled island Beijing claims as its own territory.\nLi called for mutual respect and Sino-U.S. cooperation to promote \u201cextensive common interests\u201d in resolving global problems and promoting trade, science and other fields.\n\u201cBoth countries stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation,\u201d Li said.\nOn Thursday, three pro-democracy lawmakers were ejected from Hong Kong\u2019s legislative chamber during a debate over a bill that would criminalize insulting or abusing the Chinese national anthem.\nAlso Thursday, the NPC approved a government budget that will increase spending to generate jobs to try to reverse an economic slump after Chinese industries were shut down to fight the coronavirus pandemic.\nPrivate sector analysts say as much as 30% of the urban workforce, or as many as 130 million people, lost their jobs at least temporarily during the shutdown. They say as many as 25 million jobs might be lost for good this year.\nThe budget calls for giving local governments 2 trillion yuan ($280 billion) to spend on meeting goals including creating 9 million new jobs. That is in line with expectations of higher spending but a fraction of the $1 trillion-plus stimulus packages launched or discussed by the United States, Japan and Europe.\nLi, the premier, said Beijing is in a \u201cstrong position to introduce new measures\u201d if necessary but wants to avoid flooding the economy with too much money. He said 70% of planned spending is aimed at putting wages in workers\u2019 pockets in order to support consumer spending, the biggest driver of the economy.\n\u201cWe will do our utmost to keep China\u2019s economic growth stable,\u201d Li said. \u201cAt the same time, we must make sure that all measures taken are well calibrated.\u201d\nIn an anti-virus measure, Li sat on a dais in the Great Hall of the People, the seat of the legislature in central Beijing, and talked by video link with reporters at a media center 4 miles (6.5 kilometers) away. The reporters, wearing masks, sat in widely spaced chairs in an auditorium, watching Li on a video screen.\nHe called for international cooperation in fighting the coronavirus pandemic but didn\u2019t answer a question about how an investigation into the origins of the pandemic demanded by Washington and some other governments should be conducted.\nBeijing has resisted pressure for an inquiry following criticism it mishandled the early response to the disease that emerged in central China in December. China has blocked beef imports from four Australian suppliers in apparent retaliation for Australia\u2019s calls for an investigation."}}
