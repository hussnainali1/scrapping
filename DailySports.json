No water breaks were allowed. \n\nThe incident is listed among the findings in previously undisclosed confidential U.S. Center for SafeSport documents shared with the Southern California News Group that describe the \u201cimpossible conditioning\u201d Nyman, the wife of USA Gymnastics\u2019 former director of sport medicine and science, allegedly forced young athletes to endure. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nNyman, the New Heights owner and head coach, ordered gymnasts to do so many repeat rope climbs that the insides of their legs bled and their arms were too sore to continue training, according to the documents. When a New Heights gymnast said she was afraid to attempt a balance beam skill during a 2016 camp the team was attending in Pennsylvania, Nyman ridiculed the girl in front of her teammates, then made her do a series of sprints up a hill and 1,000 push-ups, according the SafeSport documents.\u00a0 It took the girl so long to complete the push-ups that she missed dinner. \n\n\u201cThis conduct not only emotionally effected claimant and several teammates but it was likely to be perceived as abuse and served little purpose other than to humiliate claimant for fear in performing a skill,\u201d a SafeSport official wrote. \nThe U.S. Center for \nNyman was suspended an additional year for retaliating against two adult individuals who participated with the SafeSport investigation. \n\nSafeSport, citing a preponderance of evidence provided by 14 claimants found that Nyman \u201ccreated an environment at her gym that had little positive enforcement and made minor (-aged) gymnasts constantly feel scared, degraded and humiliated.\u201d \n\nNyman is prohibited from participating in USA Gymnastics sanctioned events or having any contact with USA Gymnastics members or sanctioned clubs or businesses until Oct. 3, 2021. \n\nNyman\u2019s suspension came against the backdrop of USA Gymnastics hearings on allegations of physical, verbal and emotional abuse against Maggie Haney, the New Jersey-based coach of Olympic and world champion gymnasts. \nThe juxtaposition of the Nyman and Haney suspensions has sparked outrage among Nyman\u2019s alleged victims and their families and supporters. It has also raised concerns about what critics charge is a lack of uniformity regarding sanctions and procedures between SafeSport and national governing bodies like USA Gymnastics. \n\nNyman\u2019s suspension, said Judie Saunders, an attorney for some of the alleged victims, \u201cgoes against the weight of the (SafeSport) report.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe punishment does not seem fair or in line with events\u201d that were detailed in SafeSport\u2019s findings,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very frustrating process and a woefully inadequate suspension if you can even call it a suspension.\u201d \n\nThe Nyman case highlights how sanctions for similar offenses can vary significantly among SafeSport and national governing bodies, athletes and athlete rights advocates said. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no consistency at all in it,\u201d said Jonathan Little, an attorney who has represented dozens of sexual abuse victims in Olympic sports. \n\n\u201cMy concern is that everyone in the Olympic movement should know where the lines are,\u201d said Nancy Hogshead-Makar, an Olympic swimming gold medalist and founder of Champion Women, an advocacy group for girls and women in sports. \u201cThat\u2019s how you get people to buy in and they\u2019re not buying into it now because they don\u2019t trust it.\u201d \n\nDan Hill, a spokesman for the U.S. Center for SafeSport, countered that the SafeSport code \u201cis a consistent and unifying message against abuse and sets clearly what isn\u2019t permitted.\u201d \n\nThe Nyman case has also raised questions about the competency of the SafeSport staff and the process for deciding whether the U.S. Center for SafeSport or national governing body has jurisdiction over certain abuse cases. \n\nSafeSport investigators shared private medical and personal information about alleged victims and their family members in a report that was accessible to dozens of individuals. The center later redacted the medical and personal information in an updated report after it was alerted to the breach, according to Hill. SafeSport has since taken additional steps to ensure claimants have more control over what information is shared with others, Hill said. \n\nGymnasts and their families\u2019 anxiety about the case was further heightened, parents said, by how long it took to resolve and by SafeSport investigators\u2019 failures to respond to emails, phone calls and texts in a timely manner \u2013 if they responded at all. An attorney for Nyman also complained about the length of the case. Nyman\u2019s suspension came 15 months after it was referred to SafeSport and 32 months after USA Gymnastics began investigating New Heights. \n\n\u201cThe center has acknowledged that it wants to resolve matters faster without compromising quality and thoroughness,\u201d Hill said. \n\nSafeSport\u2019s staff has grown from 36 in July 2019 to 65 employees. The center has 16 investigators, double that of a year ago. \n\nBut in terms of response and resolution, Hill acknowledged \u201cthere\u2019s still room for improvement there.\u201d \n\nNyman has appealed the suspension and an arbitrator is scheduled to hear her appeal over three days beginning June 29. The arbitrator is Christian S. Dennie, a Fort Worth attorney. Dennie last year reduced a SafeSport lifetime ban of Richard Callaghan, coach of Olympic skating champion Tara Lipinski, to three years. Callaghan was banned for sexually abusing a male teenage skater starting in the 1970s. \n\nDennie found that Callaghan had committed sexual misconduct but reduced the ban because \u201cSafeSport failed to produce corroborating evidence as required\u201d to meet the criminal statues upon which the complaint was based. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bet my house on it that the whole thing is getting overturned,\u201d said Russell Prince, Nyman\u2019s attorney who also represents Haney. \u201cAmy Nyman is not coming out of this with a suspension. It\u2019s not going to happen. This is one of the easiest (appeals) I\u2019ve seen. It\u2019s not Maggie Haney stuff. It\u2019s cut and dried.\u201d \n\nSafeSport cleared two New Heights assistant coaches of verbally abusing gymnasts and violating USA Gymnastics policies prohibiting the consumption of alcohol in the presence of minor-aged athletes. \n\nThe center also cleared Edward Nyman Jr., Amy\u2019s husband, \n\u201cDr. Nyman was terminated for his failure to disclose athlete safety complaints involving the club with which he is affiliated to USA Gymnastics,\u201d USA Gymnastics said in a statement to SCNG. \u201cThis demonstrated poor judgment and created a conflict of interest that disqualified him from serving in this important role.\u00a0 We are confident this was the best decision for the welfare of our athletes and our community.\u201d \n\nBut Edward Nyman said in an interview with SCNG that he discussed complaints made against New Heights and his wife extensively with Mark Busby, a USA Gymnastics in-house counsel, before he was hired. \n\n against Amy Nyman and New Heights since at least the summer of 2017, according to a person familiar with the complaint. Busby, in late January or early February 2019, encouraged a parent to file a complaint against Amy Nyman and New Heights with USA Gymnastics and U.S. Center for SafeSport, according to four people familiar with the complaints. \n\nThe complaints against New Heights were serious enough for USA Gymnastics to refer them to the U.S. Center for SafeSport in February 2019, two months before Nyman was hired. The complaints allege emotional and verbal abuse, and that Edward Nyman, who has a PhD. in biomechanics, conducted physical exams on New Heights athletes. \n\nBeginning in 2016, under what club officials described as \u201cInjury Prevention Screening and Protocols,\u201d gymnasts were required to undergo \u201cphysical and injury prevention screening\u201d conducted by Edward Nyman in the New Heights gym, according to four people familiar with the case. Parents were charged $75 for the initial screening and between $75 to $200 if additional consulting was required, according to documents. \n\nNyman denied any wrongdoing and there were no allegations of sexual misconduct. \n\n\u201cThese are not exams,\u201d Nyman said. \u201cThey\u2019re functional movement type screenings. They do this all over the world. I\u2019m looking for symmetry or strength changes, like if one leg is weaker compared to the other. \n\n\u201cThis is my expertise. This is what I\u2019m world renown for. I\u2019m not physically doing any medical (procedures). I\u2019m not touching athletes in any way, shape or form.\u201d \n\nThe allegations are not referred to in either SafeSport\u2019s 639-page investigative report by Libby Bailey, the center\u2019s assistant director of intake and a senior investigator, or the notice of decision. \n\nCiting what it described as a \u201cthorough investigation,\u201d SafeSport found Amy Nyman engaged \u201cin emotional and physical misconduct against multiple minor (-aged) athletes\u201d between 2002 to 2005 and 2010 to 2019. The physical misconduct refers to excessive and punitive conditioning and not Nyman physically touching athletes in an abusive manner, according to SafeSport documents. \n\nNyman had young gymnasts do conditioning that \u201cexceeded appropriate amounts\u201d and resulted in \u201cphysical injuries.\u201d She required girls to keep food journals, which SafeSport found \u201chad a signature negative effect on the emotional health of multiple young gymnasts.\u201d \n\nGymnasts, SafeSport said, \u201crepeatedly heard degrading comments\u201d from Nyman. The coach referred to one gymnast as a \u201cwaste of her mom\u2019s money,\u201d according to SafeSport documents. \n\nNyman, according to SafeSport, also threatened to isolate gymnasts she was upset with by sitting them in a \u201ccrybaby chair,\u201d an approximately six-inch tall, plastic Little Tikes chair placed against the gym\u2019s wall. \n\nSafeSport also found Nyman violated USA Gymnastics policies by drinking in front of gymnasts during a trip to a 2017 meet in Charleston, South Carolina. Nyman was \u201cfalling down blotto,\u201d according to one witness cited in a SafeSport document. Nyman denied drinking but one assistant coach acknowledged to SafeSport that the coaches \u201cmay have a had a few drinks.\u201d \n\nNyman, SafeSport said, also drank wine in front of at least five minor-aged gymnasts during what one parent described as a three-hour tirade by the coach at a 2018 camp in Cincinnati. \n\nSafeSport also found that Nyman\u2019s removal of two judges from a meet she was directing was retaliation for the judges cooperating with the center\u2019s investigation. \n\nNyman\u2019s retaliatory behavior, SafeSport said, \u201ccan dissuade participants from participating with investigations and undermine the center\u2019s resolution process.\u201d \n\nSafeSport said it asked Nyman to give a reason for the judges\u2019 removal. Nyman provided, SafeSport said, \u201cno articulable reason other than the center\u2019s investigation to remove them from the meet.\u201d \n\nNyman \u201cdid not provide an alternate reason despite the opportunity and specific request to do so.\u201d \n\nThe suspension for retaliation was significant, Hogshead-Makar said, because it marked only the second time the center had issued a sanction for retaliatory behavior. \n\nPrince, however, said he is confident that retaliation charge will not stand. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the whole retaliation argument is even going to make it to arbitration,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt (SafeSport) will drop the retaliation charge or else they\u2019re going to face significant legal exposure. \n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t drop the retaliation, they\u2019re staring a lawsuit in the face they can\u2019t win.\u201d \n\nPrince described the SafeSport investigative report as \u201claughable. It\u2019s 800 pages of gobbledygook.\u201d \n\nPrince said SafeSport is needed, but complained that the current investigative and adjudication processes are slanted against the accused. \n\n\u201cSafeSport is a sham,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole system is a sham.\u201d \n\nAttorneys on both sides said they supported an overhaul of SafeSport, including the adoption of procedures more in line with practices in state and federal courts. Both sides, echoing a familiar complaint, also urged more transparency in the decision-making process behind whether SafeSport or a national governing body handles abuse complaints. \n\nThe U.S. Center for SafeSport has jurisdiction over sexual abuse cases in Olympic sports. National governing bodies such as USA Gymnastics can handle physical, emotional and verbal abuse cases or they can refer them to the center if there are conflict-of-interest or systemic issues involved in the case. \n\nHill declined to comment on why the Nyman case was referred to SafeSport. \n\nUSA Gymnastics said in a statement \u201cUSAG is unable to comment on the details of individual cases. In general, when a report comes to USA Gymnastics, we make a determination whether or not to send it to the Center. We immediately send any case to the Center if it has exclusive jurisdiction in those matters, as it does with sexual abuse cases. However, we may also request that the Center take jurisdiction over other cases where there is the potential for a conflict of interest that could prevent a fair process \u2013 e.g., if we were involved in a lawsuit with a related party.\u201d \n\nThe Nyman case, according to longtime observers of the American Olympic movement\u2019s efforts to address abuse, highlights the need for uniformity in sanctions between SafeSport and the NGBs. \n\nThe length of Nyman\u2019s suspension was based on \u201cmitigating factors,\u201d SafeSport wrote, including that she had \u201cno prior history of misconduct with the center\u201d and her misconduct did not involve any physical contact with athletes. \n\nHill said \u201cthe SafeSport code is consistent and it applies across the movement and defines what abuse is and what action organizations need to take to prevent abuse.\u201d \n\nBut Little and other athlete advocates support SafeSport and the NGBs adopting a uniform \u201cpunishment code with minimum (sanctions). So you could start building, for lack of a better term, a case. You can say, \u2018This gymnastics coach did this. And so if the track coach did this, they get this.\u2019\u201d \n  \n\t\t\t"},"4":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tUSC QB JT Daniels transfers to Georgia\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/05\/28\/usc-qb-jt-daniels-transfers-to-georgia\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/LDN-L-USC-FBC-0306-881-SV-1.jpg?w=510","discription":"\nAfter speculation he may still return to USC, JT Daniels made his departure from Troy official on Thursday. \n\nThe former Trojan quarterback is transferring to Georgia, he announced on Twitter, signing off with a short message: \u201cTHANK YOU USC. Excited for the future.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nA former five-star recruit from Mater Dei, Daniels started for USC in 2018 as a true freshman. He completed 216 of 363 passes that season for 2,672 yards, 14 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. \n\nHe beat out a four-man field for the starting job again in 2019 but suffered a season-ending ACL tear in the second quarter of the season opener that required surgery. In his lone half as a sophomore, Daniels completed 25 of 34 passes for 215 yards and a touchdown and interception apiece. \nThis allowed true freshman Kedon Slovis a chance at quarterback. Even after his surgery, Daniels remained a consistent presence at USC practices and helped Slovis throughout his freshman campaign. \n\nSlovis won Pac-12 Offensive Freshman of the Year honors after completing 72 percent of his passes for 3,502 yards, 30 touchdowns and nine interceptions, and has since garnered speculation as a potential Heisman candidate in 2020. \n\nStill, USC head coach Clay Helton planned to keep the quarterback competition open for Daniels to earn back the job, but Daniels entered the transfer portal in April. \n\nNow a redshirt sophomore, Daniels will have to apply for a waiver for immediate eligibility at Georgia. If he receives the waiver, he will have three years of eligibility remaining. \n\nIf eligible in 2020, Daniels will compete with Wake Forest transfer Jamie Newman for the starting job. Newman, who committed to the Bulldogs in January, completed 60.9 percent of his passes as a junior and threw for 2,868 yards, 26 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. \nBut Newman is a graduate transfer and has just one year of eligibility remaining, making Daniels the presumptive starter in 2020 for Georgia, which went 12-2 this past season and beat Baylor in the Sugar Bowl. The other quarterbacks on the Georgia roster are redshirt junior Stetson Bennett IV, redshirt freshman D\u2019Wan Mathis and highly recruited true freshman Carson Beck, who enrolled early. \n\nDaniels\u2019 departure leaves USC with two scholarship quarterbacks on roster: Slovis and senior Matt Fink. USC also added Vanderbilt transfer Mo Hasan as a walk-on this spring. \n\nFink offered a different potential path for Daniels. Fink entered the transfer portal last summer, flirting with Illinois before opting to return to USC. \n\nHelton and his staff kept this door open to Daniels, too, as he remained a part of USC\u2019s quarterback and team meetings even after the program announced he was exploring his options for a transfer. \n\nBut Daniels has opted for Georgia and the SEC rather than stay at USC. \n\nDaniels first arrived at USC after reclassifying from a junior in high school to a senior, the next in a long line of Trojan quarterbacks from Mater Dei including Matt Leinart and Matt Barkley. In his final season at Mater Dei, Daniels led the Monarchs to a 15-0 record and a consensus national championship. \n\nHe won the starting job at USC as a freshman over Fink and Jack Sears, who earlier this month transferred to Boise State. \n\nAfter losing half of its quarterback room, Slovis is the presumptive starter for USC, though Helton said in an interview with the Southern California News Group last month that he will keep the competition open for Fink even without Daniels in the fold. \n\n\u201cWe always compete at all positions. Training camp is an opportunity to compete,\u201d \nIn that interview, Helton did not rule out the possibility of adding a third scholarship quarterback via transfer. But that comment was in the context of the question of whether the NCAA would grant one-time immediate eligibility waiver to transfers. \n\nIn a vote last week, the NCAA postponed passing such a rule until January, complicating USC\u2019s options. The Trojans could look at adding a graduate transfer, or signing a younger QB and hope he receives a waiver from the NCAA to play in 2020. \n"},"5":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tDodgers minor leaguers will get bonus out of David Price\u2019s pocket\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/05\/29\/dodgers-minor-leaguers-will-get-bonus-out-of-david-prices-pocket\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Dodgers-Reds-Spring-Baseball-2-1-1.jpg?w=525","discription":"\nDodgers minor leaguers will continue to receive $400 a week from the team at least through June, and each will also receive $1,000 as a goodwill gesture from star pitcher David Price, a club spokesman confirmed on Friday morning. \n\nMinor leaguers throughout the sport were set to have their $400 weekly payments run through May, but the Dodgers have opted to continue them at least another month. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe Dodgers are among about a dozen teams that have committed to continue the payments, while so far only the Oakland A\u2019s have revealed that they will not pay their minor leaguers.

The death of George Floyd, a friend of former NBA player Stephen Jackson who died after being arrested by Minneapolis police, \nSocial activism by athletes precedes the Donald Sterling affair in 2014, but the scandal and subsequent booting of Sterling from the league represented a tide change to many in the NBA \u2014 a moment when players saw that they had power in their platform, and that the league and other owners had to acknowledge it. And that\u2019s why \n\u201cIt was a time when they spoke up, spoke out, and found communities of fans and an institution that agreed, \u2018This guy\u2019s gotta go,\u2019\u201d Jacobs said in a conversation with the Southern California News Group. \u201cIt empowered a generation of players to feel like their voices were heard, all the moreso five years later, their influence has gotten greater and they\u2019ve been emboldened.\u201d \n\n harkens to before pandemics, when the Sterling tapes posed one of the greatest existential crises the league had ever faced. The beats will be familiar to even to casual observers of the circus that surrounded the Clippers back then, but with added commentary from Paul, DeAndre Jordan, Doc Rivers, J.J. Redick, Adam Silver and numerous others offering context behind one of the strangest events in pro sports. \n\nThe means of telling the story is fresh: While ESPN did a podcast on the Sterling tapes last summer, this is the first comprehensive film documentary on the subject cut into episodes shorter than 10 minutes (in accordance with Quibi\u2019s emphasis on bite-sized episodic content). Interviews were conducted through a technology that has the subject look directly into the camera, creating an arresting intimacy with the people who helped navigate the Clippers and the NBA through the crisis. \n\u201cOn set, when we\u2019re shooting the interviews, it is very intense and very personal,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cIt\u2019s for the removal of the interviewer, to create a one-to-one relationship with the audience. You are right there, very close to these subjects.\u201d \n\nAnd the subjects don\u2019t seem to hold many punches: There\u2019s depictions of terse team meetings and phone calls, as players describe how they very nearly didn\u2019t take the court for Game 4 against Golden State, how Doc Rivers describes balancing feelings of wanting to lead his team and compete while furious with Sterling and other Clippers leadership. \nIt\u2019s worth noting that filmmakers weighed reaching out to Sterling before ultimately deciding to proceed without his side of the story \u2014 perhaps a wise choice given Sterling\u2019s rambling, nonsensical CNN interview that was meant as an apology and served as doubling down in the aftermath of the tapes. Players and others inside the locker room were the people Jacobs and his team wished to highlight. While ESPN\u2019s podcast took a long, glaring look at Sterling\u2019s spotty record as a discriminatory landlord with a taste for mistresses, \nIt\u2019s fallout that Jacobs still is a little incredulous that the Clippers have come out of as a functional organization, still in Los Angeles, still with the same name that was once inexorably linked with not only losing, but with its miserly, racially biased owner. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s stranger than fiction; it\u2019s the Hollywood script you could never write,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cWhen you go through the Clippers organization and read about all sorts of stuff about their mismanagement, it\u2019s amazing they\u2019ve been able to hang on with Steve Ballmer coming in. If they had moved the franchise, it would have made way more sense to me than it ultimately turned out. But in a weird way, it is kind of a Hollywood ending.\u201d \n\nThe best way to leave the past behind is to build a glorious future \u2014 and \nA red carpet debut was not in the cards for \n\u201cMy sports friends who are familiar with the story are just stoked to hear sports content,\u201d he said. \u201cBut other people have told me they really like the culture story.

When people ask me about my season, I\u2019m like, what season?\u201d \n\nThe USC men\u2019s basketball program entered postseason play winners of their last three games, clinching a first-round bye in the Pac-12 tournament with a dramatic win over rival UCLA. \n\nThen, it was over. The conference tournament, March Madness, Rakocevic and Mathews\u2019 college days, all brought to an end by COVID-19. \n\nThe two months between then and now have done little to damper the disappointment of Rakocevic, who described his NCAA Tournament experience as a freshman as the best of his life. \n\u201cIt just got cut, just like that. There\u2019s really not much you can do,\u201d Rakocevic says. \u201cThe mojo that we had and the confidence that we had heading into the Pac-12 tournament, I\u2019d never seen it before.

We\u2019re legends here.\u201d \n\nThat\u2019s the lone consolation for Rakocevic. That final streak made Rakocevic and Mathews the all-time winningest players in USC history. Mathews broke the school\u2019s career 3-point record, while Rakocevic is second all-time in rebounds. \n\nMathews finds comfort in those spots in the USC record book, too. But he found it easier than Rakocevic to move on from how the season ended, in part because of his dramatic final act as a Trojan. \n\nIt was Mathews who hit the game-winning 3-pointer with one second remaining to beat UCLA in the season finale. Such a shot against his school\u2019s bitterest rival had a therapeutic effect on Mathews. \n\n\u201cI made peace with it a couple days after, because for me it was different,\u201d he says. \u201cIt ended in a way that I could make terms with it.\u201d \n\nNow all that\u2019s left for the pair to do is to prepare for the NBA Draft. \n\nBoth remain in Los Angeles, working at private gyms set up by their respective agencies. And both have started the process of interviewing with potential NBA employers. \n\nMathews, who has met with eight teams, has found the process of interviewing over video chats awkward. And he\u2019s been caught off guard by some teams\u2019 questions, like when one executive asked what he would do if a woman slapped him in a bar. \n\n\u201cThey want to gauge your personality so they can know, \u2018Do we want this guy on our team or not?\u2019 \u201d Mathews says. \u201cI said I wouldn\u2019t do anything, because if you say anything more than that, then they\u2019ll go, \u2018Ok, he\u2019s crazy.\u2019 \u201c \n\nUsually, prospects would be doing team workouts and preparing for the final month before the draft. But with the postponement of the draft lottery, the process could drag on into the fall. \n\nMathews is keeping his mentality simple in the midst of the uncertainty. \n\n\u201cThe end goal is make money and do what you love.

They\u2019re on the same page. They know what\u2019s up. I know what\u2019s up. \u2026 Everybody knew what type of situation it was going to be once they traded for me. I think it doesn\u2019t need to be talked about that much. It\u2019ll get handled.\u201d \n\nRather than going after his next contract with the passion that prompted him to show up at Jaguars camp last fall in a bank truck, Ramsey is spending more time working on his burgeoning bond with new Rams defensive coordinator Brandon Staley. \nRather than isolating Ramsey as a seldom-targeted shutdown corner, Staley indicated last week that the former Florida State safety could play all over the secondary for Los Angeles next season. \n\nRamsey doesn\u2019t want to give away the Rams\u2019 plans, but he\u2019s up for the challenges ahead. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m very excited about the way I\u2019m going to be utilized in this defense,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cI\u2019ll leave it at that. I think my talents will be shown thoroughly.\u201d \n\nRamsey didn\u2019t get his big contract from the Jaguars, who drafted him in 2016 and watched him become an All-Pro a year later. After his tongue-in-cheek armored truck stunt didn\u2019t work, he requested a trade several weeks later. \n\nRamsey\u2019s clashes with Tom Coughlin and the Jags\u2019 front office are only a bad memory now. The Rams have nothing but praise for their defensive centerpiece alongside Aaron Donald, and they seem eager to lock up the long-term future of a player who cost them two first-round draft picks in the trade. \n\nByron Jones became the NFL\u2019s highest-paid cornerback in March when he agreed to a five-year, $82.5 million deal including $57 million guaranteed with the Miami Dolphins. Ramsey\u2019s deal likely will eclipse Jones\u2019 contract, and the Rams aren\u2019t shy about making big commitments: general manager Les Snead has recently re-signed players to the biggest contracts ever given to a quarterback, a running back and a defensive player. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of dialogue\u201d between Ramsey\u2019s agents and the Rams, coach Sean McVay said. \n\n\u201cWhat I can speak on is how impressed I\u2019ve been with Jalen, the leadership I\u2019m watching him take from afar,\u201d McVay said. \u201cWhen he came in, I was so impressed with him at first. But now you\u2019re actually able to have a foundation \u2026 and this is a really impressive guy. You really get a feel for his football acumen, and how much he\u2019s able to understand and absorb.\u201d \n\nRamsey has already formed a solid bond with Staley, the Rams\u2019 rookie coordinator. They\u2019re speaking over the phone about three times per day, and Staley is eagerly exploring new ways to use Ramsey\u2019s talents. \n\n\u201cI love coaching this guy,\u201d Staley said last week. \u201cOne of the unique parts about this whole thing is the relationship that I\u2019ve been able to form with him in a short time. This guy has been really, really fun to work with. He\u2019s got a high capacity to learn, he\u2019s got a high capacity to lead. This game means a lot to him.

Perhaps it\u2019s not fair to label a rookie quarterback as a \u201cface of a franchise,\u201d but that\u2019s what many expect from him in the years to come, and Hamilton was hired to guide Herbert to that esteemed status. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThere\u2019s plenty of pressure on the Chargers\u2019 new quarterbacks coach, but you couldn\u2019t tell from Wednesday\u2019s introductory Zoom call. The easygoing Hamilton bantered with reporters and poked fun at one\u2019s quarantine mustache (this reporter). \n\n\u201cIs that a real mustache?\u201d Hamilton asked. \u201cWhat was your question again?\u201d \nThe question: How tough is it to balance a quarterback competition while trying to groom a first-round quarterback at the same time? \n\nHerbert will compete with veteran quarterback Tyrod Taylor, who\u2019s been referred to by Chargers coach Anthony Lynn as being in the driver\u2019s seat to start. \n\nHamilton, 45, wasn\u2019t stalling to answer the question. He\u2019s seen all types of quarterback battles dating back to his first coaching gig as Howard\u2019s quarterbacks coach in 1997, one year after playing quarterback for the university. Hamilton has coached for the New York Jets, San Francisco 49ers, Chicago Bears and Cleveland Browns. \n\nHe was instrumental in the development of former star quarterback Andrew Luck as an assistant coach at Stanford and with the Indianapolis Colts. Hamilton was Luck\u2019s offensive coordinator from 2013 to 2015. \n\nSo back to the question. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s necessarily a tough thing to do,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cI think whenever we get on the field, I think guys are going to organically separate themselves. I do think that football is such that when given the opportunity to go out and play, and play at a level that\u2019s going to give our team a chance to win games, it shows through reps and it shows in time.\u201d \n\nNew QB coach Pep Hamilton \n\u2014 Gilbert Manzano (@GManzano24) \n\n\nHamilton and the Chargers don\u2019t plan on rushing Herbert\u2019s development, but they\u2019re expecting the former Oregon quarterback to push Taylor for the starting gig. \n\n\u201cThey are different players,\u201d Hamilton said when asked if there are any similarities between Herbert and Luck. \u201cBut you know, I think the one thing that they have in common is the fact that they were drafted with the expectation of being able to come in and play at a high level whenever they get the opportunity to play. So we\u2019re preparing Justin to be ready to come in and compete to play from Day 1.\u201d \n\nHamilton, who was officially hired this month, hasn\u2019t worked with Herbert in person, but he\u2019s gotten to know him virtually, saying the two have had many football conversations that have gone into the wee hours of the night. \n\n\u201cSmart kid,\u201d Hamilton said of Herbert. \u201cVery smart. Football is important to him. \u2026 I\u2019m excited to see that he\u2019s a student of the game.\u201d \n\nHamilton hasn\u2019t coached in the NFL since 2016. He was an assistant head coach at Michigan for two seasons and was the general manager and head coach of the XFL\u2019s DC Defenders for five games before the startup league folded in April. \n\nHamilton wasn\u2019t unemployed for long. He has another coaching gig, one with plenty of pressure, but that\u2019s nothing new to him. \n\n\n\nThe Chargers reopened their facility Tuesday with only a few executives allowed inside the Costa Mesa building. \n\nThey plan to slowly allow more people inside the facility in the coming days while following all safety guidelines. NFL facilities were closed two months ago because of the coronavirus pandemic and were allowed to reopen last week. \n\nThe next phase would be to allow players and coaches inside the building and eventually on the practice field, but there\u2019s no telling when that time will come. \n\nRight tackle Bryan Bulaga, the Chargers\u2019 free-agent acquisition, has spent his offseason in Florida. Bulaga said he\u2019s planning to gradually move into his new Los Angeles home in the next few weeks. \n\nBulaga is itching to meet his new teammates in person, but he\u2019s skeptical about potentially jumping into a mandatory minicamp next month if the league and the state allows it. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can just go out there for a week of minicamp and do it how we normally do it,\u201d Bulaga said. \u201cPut on helmets and fly around and do that. I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s possible. I think there\u2019s health risk involved there, not coronavirus health, but with guys\u2019 bodies; hamstrings, knees. \n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t done any football movements and then you\u2019re going to put us in front of each other and then say, \u2018Hey, go at it.\u2019 I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to work out, but I can see it more of a jog through tempo. More teaching than actually live speed.\u201d \n\n\n\nFirst-year Chargers cornerback Chris Harris Jr. was named to the league\u2019s 2010s All-Decade Team in April. That\u2019s one of many awards Harris earned during his nine seasons with the Denver Broncos. \n\nHarris, 30, is hoping a fresh start with the Chargers will lead to more awards, including the prestigious Hall of Fame. \n\n\u201cLast year, there was a lot of stuff going on with me,\u201d Harris said about his final year with the Broncos, which included trade rumors. \u201cMentally, you never know how stuff wears down on you. I think it just did. Naturally as a human it did. Going into this year, I feel so happy. I got a clear mind and I\u2019m hungry. I\u2019m not done. I got a lot of goals I want to achieve. I want to be in the Hall of Fame. I want to continue to get Pro Bowls and All-Pros.\u201d \n\nBefore the rocky ending, the Broncos signed Harris as an undrafted free agent in 2011 out of the University of Kansas. He made four Pro Bowls, one First-Team All-Pro, two Second-Team All-Pros and won Super Bowl 50. \n\nThere was plenty of good for Harris in Denver, a stint that started with Chargers defensive backs coach Ron Milus grooming the undrafted free agent. Milus held the same position in Denver and coached Harris from 2011 to 2012. \n\n\u201cAlways play that slot (cornerback position),\u201d Harris recalled what Milus told him in Denver. \u201cHe said that\u2019s my spot. That\u2019s one thing he told me. He said, \u2018Whatever you do, if you can play outside or safety, always try to play that slot.\u2019 He said I\u2019m one of the best at it.\u201d \n\nOne of the Chargers\u2019 intriguing offseason storylines is where Harris and Desmond King will line up in the secondary this season. King was named First-Team All-Pro as a slot cornerback in 2018. \n  \n\t\t\t"},"15":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tNHL return plan leaves Ducks, Kings out, but could still involve LA\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/05\/27\/nhl-return-plan-leaves-ducks-kings-out-but-could-still-involve-la\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/AP20147639756126-1.jpg?w=539","discription":"\nWhile the NHL made long strides toward a return to play, the Kings and Ducks will still be running in place for the foreseeable future. \n\nOver the Memorial Day weekend, the league accelerated its pace toward a return to the ice following its shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. First, the NHL Players Association voted to further discussion of a plan for a 24-team playoff to be completed during what would usually be the offseason.\u00a0 Gary Bettman laid out some details Tuesday regarding a potential return to play. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nTwenty-four of the league\u2019s 31 teams will qualify for a playoff that will include eight byes, a play-in round with best-of-five series, a round-robin among the bye earners and, in all cases, games played at one of two host sites without fans in attendance. The timeline would see this season conclude roughly in September and next season begin as late as necessary, likely sometime during the winter. \n\nThe Ducks and Kings, however, need not concern themselves too deeply. They are both among the seven teams \u2014 along with San Jose, Ottawa, Detroit, New Jersey and Buffalo \u2013not participating in the expanded postseason if it comes to fruition. \nWhen play was suspended on March 12, The Kings had just won what turned out to be the final game of the NHL regular season, giving them their seventh straight victory and boosting them above San Jose to avert a last place finish in the West. The Ducks finished ahead of the Kings and five points behind 12th place Chicago, the final qualifying team under the nearly all-inclusive format. The Ducks had 11 games remaining on their schedule to attempt to close that gap. \n\n\u201cWhile we would have preferred to conclude our season normally and play 82 games, it became obvious over time that was not practical,\u201d the Ducks said in a statement. \u201cWe appreciate the NHL and NHLPA working together to award the Stanley Cup in these unique circumstances. We also want to thank our fans for their support and patience. We remain excited about our future and can\u2019t wait for the 2020-21 season.\u201d \n\nBoth Southern California franchises are affected by the league\u2019s course of action in other ways. The seven teams that will not compete in the tournament as well as the play-in round\u2019s losing sides will be in a revised draft lottery to determine who receives the first three selections in this year\u2019s draft, the date of which has been postponed and remains to be determined. The Kings have a 9.5 percent chance at the top overall selection, while the Ducks have an 8.5 percent probability. \n\nThe Kings and Ducks\u2019 players are also affected by just how much revenue this revamped playoff can generate. With the cancellation of between 11 and 14 regular-season games for each franchise as well as the reality that the playoffs are likely to be played without any gate revenue from fan attendance, league revenue will dip. That impacts players directly, as their salaries are tethered to the revenue pool. \n\nEach player places a portion of his salary in escrow, and the amount he receives back from that depends on the financial success of the league. Shortfalls in league revenue impact both the portion placed into escrow the following season, and a portion of a season or an entire season without fans could also impact the amount of money placed into escrow that\u2019s retained by players. \nPlayer salaries in sum are to represent 50 percent of the league\u2019s hockey-related revenue as enumerated in its collective bargaining agreement. An underestimate could result in bonuses or an overestimate, as would certainly be the case under these circumstances, results in salary losses. League revenue also impacts the salary cap for the forthcoming season. The cap may have been in a position to increase substantially prior to suspending play, and now it remains to be seen how it will differ from the $81 million figure for the 2019-20 campaign. \n\nOn Tuesday, Bettman confirmed that there were 10 NHL arenas being considered for the two sites where the playoffs would be played. Among them was Staples Center. Bettman said that the decision regarding host cities would be made as late as possible so as to have the most accurate logistical and public health information, with a decision likely coming in three to four weeks. \n\nOne city would host the Eastern Conference and another would host the West. Seven Western Conference cities were among the 10 possible sites, but Bettman said the conference affiliation of the host city\u2019s franchise would not impact which city hosted which conference. Safety, health and the adequacy of facilities would impact which cities are selected rather than geographical location, Bettman said. \n\nMinnesota Wild player representative and goalie Devan Dubnyk emphasized to The Athletic that the players voted solely on a format in the event that play were to resume, adding that many details were still be agreed upon. Bettman addressed many concerns regarding the proposal, but also said that significant aspects of it were yet to be determined. The conference quarterfinals, for example, may be best-of-five or more traditional best-of-seven series. The conference finals might be played in different buildings or in the same one, with the location of the Stanley Cup Final still unknown as well, in addition to myriad logistical and health considerations being weighed. \n\n\u201cThe challenging parts are going to be finding the venues that can handle the amount of play that\u2019s going to happen, the ice conditions in the warm summer climate. There\u2019s a lot of things that I worry about in terms of the players\u2019 safety,\u201d former Kings center Jeremy Roenick said. \u201cWhat their conditioning is, how many games they\u2019re going to play in the course of a week. Everybody\u2019s staying in a hotel, they\u2019re separated from their families. It\u2019s going to be a tough two and a half months of hockey. But I think the league has come too far to let this whole season get canceled.\u201d \n\nThe timetable for this season, next and possibly beyond has also been altered significantly. Instead of the season beginning in October and ending in June, this campaign will potentially run into the time next season\u2019s training camp would have begun, causing a delay in next season\u2019s commencement and conclusion. \n\nBettman said the league will use the improvised schedule to research whether a long-term change is desirable or if it should consider measures in the future \u2014 for example compressed or truncated schedules \u2014 to return to a more traditional timeline that does not see a winter sport crown its champions late in the summer. \n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not what you\u2019re used to. It feels like it\u2019s baseball. It\u2019s not perfect,\u2019 said Jarome Iginla, a former scoring champion who concluded his illustrious career with the Kings. \u201cInitially I thought \u2018maybe you just don\u2019t have the season and start up at the normal time,\u2019 but there\u2019s so many unknowns with when there will be a vaccine or what\u2019s going to happen with the coronavirus that you can\u2019t really plan it. So when you have the opportunity to play, you take it.\u201d \n\nThe absence of fans is something all major sports leagues are contending with as they seek to resume play. Germany\u2019s top soccer league, the Bundesliga, returned to the pitch earlier this month sans fans and with beefy guidelines for player health and safety, much like those the NHL will likely implement. Players will likely face extensive regulations both on and off the ice, as well as the unfamiliar situation of playing an extended postseason on neutral ice, potentially far from their families and inside empty arenas. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been watching some soccer games over in Europe with no fans and it\u2019s not quite the same, let\u2019s face it,\u201d former Kings center Cliff Ronning said. \u201cHockey, especially in the playoffs, it\u2019s a very emotional game and you ride on your emotions. It\u2019s going to be difficult for the playoffs but when you\u2019re chasing the Stanley Cup, you always have to be ready for the unknown and it takes a true champion to win it.\u201d \n"},"16":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tDucks goalie Ryan Miller makes charity a priority during NHL\u2019s coronavirus break\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/05\/22\/ducks-goalie-ryan-miller-makes-charity-a-priority-during-nhls-coronavirus-break\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/LDN-L-DUCKS-0927-06-kjs_26958017_808461-1.jpg?w=505","discription":"\nRyan Miller\u2019s world came to a screeching halt one day in March, just as it did for almost everyone else. It wasn\u2019t just hockey that was put on pause because of the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the globe. It was life in general that was placed in suspended animation. \n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Miller and his Ducks teammates to wonder what they could do to help. They started by donating meals to doctors, nurses and other essential health care workers at UC Irvine Medical Center in Orange, following the charitable lead of Ducks owners Henry and Susan Samueli. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAmong other things, the Samuelis promised to pay part-time employees through June 30. \n\nAs days turned into weeks and weeks turned into months, Miller realized there was more he could do. He had old goalie equipment that he could auction off for charities in Orange County, including the Second Harvest Food Bank, and in Buffalo, New York, where he got his NHL start. \nThe Ducks had already teamed with Second Harvest, setting up a food distribution location in the Honda Center parking lot and turning over their shuttered practice rink at the Great Park in Irvine to the organization to use as a food storage facility. \n\n\u201cWe have a good group in Anaheim,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThe Samuelis really stepped up and the boys pivoted and did a nice thing. Then it was, like, \u2018OK, we\u2019ve done something as a group. What else can I do? Well, I\u2019ve got a bunch of gear in old bags in an attic and in storage.\u2019\u201d \n\nMiller, 39, began the Steadfast Foundation in 2006, while playing with the Buffalo Sabres. It was through his charity that he set up his latest fundraising effort, an online auction that features some of his pads, catching gloves, skates and sticks, plus a few donated items from teammates and rivals. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been reaching out to guys I\u2019ve played with,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s some good stuff there.\u201d \n\nThe auction runs through June 1, or perhaps later if the bids continue to roll in. \nTo view Miller\u2019s collection of gear and make a bid visit: \nSetting up the auction was one way to give back to two of the communities he\u2019s called home since entering the NHL in 2002-03 with the Sabres, after a stellar career at Michigan State. It also gave him a project to keep him busy during these days of uncertainty. \n\nLike almost everyone who\u2019s been under safer-at-home orders in California, Miller has binged-watched TV and embraced an abundance of free time with his family. He\u2019s also tried his hand at yoga as a way of staying active while awaiting whatever comes next. \n\nOn thing became certain Friday: The Ducks\u2019 last game of 2019-20 was a loss to the St. Louis Blues at Honda Center one night before play was suspended March 12. On Friday, the NHL\u2019s players association agreed to resume play with only the top 24 of the league\u2019s 31 teams returning to action. \n\nMiller might have played his final NHL game. \n\nAfter all, the Ducks were not among the top 24 teams in the standings when play was halted, so their 2019-20 season is history. Miller doesn\u2019t have a contract for the 2020-21, and although he said he would like to play, he couldn\u2019t claim to know what\u2019s next for him. \n\n\u201cIf that ends up being my final season, it would be pretty disappointing,\u201d he said of the possibility of such a jarring end to his career. \u201cThese are uncertain times and I don\u2019t know what that means for me. It would be tough to accept if it is the final opportunity for me.\u201d \n\nMiller served as a capable backup and an excellent mentor for starting goalie John Gibson for 71 games over three seasons with the Ducks, his fourth team in the NHL. Overall, he has won 387 games, the most by an American-born goalie in league history. \n\nIn addition, Miller is two wins away from tying Dominik Hasek, the man who preceded him in Buffalo and set the standard for Sabres goalies while playing 491 games. Miller played 540 games with Buffalo and forged a strong bond with the hard-scrabble city and its fans. \n\nMiller also played with the Blues and Vancouver Canucks before signing with the Ducks as a free agent July 1, 2017. As in his other stops, he\u2019s endeared himself to Ducks fans with acts of kindness such as swapping pucks for Girl Scout cookies and other treats during a pregame warmups this past season. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to close anything off,\u201d Miller said of the possibility of re-signing with the Ducks and continuing his Hall of Fame-caliber career for an 18th season in the NHL. \u201cBut I also don\u2019t want to make a decision when no one knows what\u2019s going on.\u201d \n\nLike everything else, it\u2019s a decision that has been put on hold because of the coronavirus. \n  \n\t\t\t"},"17":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tZlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 injures calf while training with AC Milan\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/05\/25\/ibrahimovi-injures-calf-while-training-with-ac-milan\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Sweden_Soccer_Ibrahimovic_Statue_48017-1-1.jpg?w=537","discription":"\nMILAN (AP) \u2014 Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 injured his calf while training for the anticipated restart of Serie A with AC Milan on Monday. \n\nThe forward will undergo medical exams on Tuesday to determine the extent of the injury, the club said. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSerie A has been suspended since March 9 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

A second fight card will be held two nights later, with ESPN televising both cards, kicking off twice weekly shows at the hotel in June and July. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nNo fans will be allowed, and Arum said fighters and everyone else will be tested at least twice during fight week for the new coronavirus. The fights are pending approval of the Nevada Athletic Commission, which meets next week to consider the events, along with two cards that the UFC plans to stage at its facility in Las Vegas. \n\nThey are also pending the reopening of the MGM and other Las Vegas hotels, something that is widely expected to happen the first week of June, though no dates for a second phase of easing virus restrictions have been announced by Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak. \n\u201cOnce we get those fights in and UFC gets its initial fights in, both of us will ask for additional dates,\u201d Arum told The Associated Press. \u201cThe key was getting enough testing, and we\u2019ve got plenty of testing in Nevada to hold our events.\u201d \n\nIn addition to Arum\u2019s fights, British promoter Eddie Hearn said this week he plans to hold fights beginning sometime in July from the backyard garden of the family mansion outside London where he was raised. Hearn told The Athletic that the first fight card is tentatively set for July 15. \n\nGolden Boy promoter Oscar De La Hoya has also talked about returning with a July 4 card, though he has offered no details. UFC returned to action earlier this month with cards in Florida, including a pay-per-view event, that took place without fans. \n\nArum declined to say who would be fighting on June 9, saying ESPN wanted to make the announcement after the fights are approved. But he said the cards would feature the same quality of fighters who were on ESPN before the shutdown of sports around the world. \n\nThe cards would be expanded to three-hour shows, Arum said, and feature a main event, a co-main and three supporting fights. \n\u201cThese will be the same guys we were going to have before to the extent possible,\u201d he said. \u201cGuys like (Olympic medalist) Shakur Stevenson and others who would have been fighting on our cards.\u201d \n\nStevenson was set to headline a Top Rank card in March at Madison Square Garden when it was called off at the last minute because of the pandemic. Another Top Rank fighter, Ireland\u2019s Michael Conlan, was to fight in New York on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, but Arum said Conlan won\u2019t be on the upcoming cards because he\u2019s unable to travel from Ireland. \n\nArum said fighters and cornermen will be tested when they arrive in Las Vegas the week of the fight and will be housed on a \u201cbubble\u201d floor at the MGM Grand. They will be allowed out only to eat at an approved restaurant in the hotel or to train at the Top Rank gym. \n\nFighters will also be tested the night before they fight. The double tests should eliminate the issue the UFC had when a fighter tested positive and was removed from the UFC 249 card, Arum said. \n\n\u201cOur protocols will be much more stringent than UFC had in Florida,\u201d Arum said. \u201cIn ours you wouldn\u2019t have a fighter testing positive the day of the fight or the day before.\u201d \n\nArum credited Jim Murren, the former MGM CEO who leads a state task force dealing with the virus, with making sure there are enough tests available for fighters, judges, commissioners and anyone else involved on site. He said 60-70 people may be tested on fight day alone, using tests that can give results in a couple hours. \n\nWhile pre-pandemic fights were held in the 16,000-seat MGM Grand Garden, Arum said the fights will be held in a convention area or ballroom at the hotel. There will be no media allowed, at least at the beginning, he said, because of the logistical difficulty of testing more people. \n\nArum\u2019s Top Rank has a long-term deal with ESPN for fights that before the pandemic hit were on the main network and streaming service ESPN+. The network also combined with Fox to televise the pay-per-view of the Tyson Fury-Deontay Wilder heavyweight title card in February that was Top Rank\u2019s last card. \n\nArum said he talked to Fury on Thursday and that plans are underway to hold the rematch \u2013 probably somewhere outside the U.S. \u2013 late this year. He said there are also still plans for a highly anticipated lightweight title unification fight between Vasiliy Lomachenko and Teofimo Lopez by the end of the year. \n  \n\t\t\t"},"20":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tU.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee announces layoffs, furloughs\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/05\/21\/usopc-announces-layoffs-furloughs\/","img":"https:\/\/images.pexels.com\/photos\/518543\/pexels-photo-518543.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940","discription":"\nU.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee CEO Sarah Hirshland told her staff Thursday that the organization is eliminating 51 positions and that another 33 employees have been placed on furlough. \n\nHirshland said last month that the organization needed to reduce expenses by 10 to 20 percent over the 2020-2024 quad to offset the financial impact of postponing the Olympic Games in Tokyo originally scheduled for this summer, and the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe USOPC is also facing a series of lawsuits related to the organizations and some of the national governing bodies under its umbrella such as USA Gymnastics, USA Swimming and USA Taekwondo. \n\nThe USOPC listed $322.86 million in revenue and $275.1 million in expenses in an Internal Revenue Service filing for the fiscal year 2018, the most recent year available.

As a result of that, we decided to proactively reduce our expenses by 10-20% over the 2020-2024 timeframe to ensure we will be able to deliver against our mission and serve Team USA athletes for years to come. We defined the principles that would guide our decisions and promised to complete our evaluation by the end of May \u2013 and I also told you that everything was on the table, including layoffs and furloughs. \n\nOver the past four weeks our leaders have worked with the support of a cross-functional team from finance, strategy and business consulting, and people and culture to evaluate their strategic priorities, operational mandates, current budgeted investments and the skills and people required to accomplish their objectives over the next 4.5 years. They did this evaluation with the goal of finding the necessary efficiency to reach our target reduction. \n\nDuring this time, we have also continued to learn more about the future and the challenges we all face in returning to work, to training and to events and competitions. It has become clear that it will take months, and not weeks, for us to return to full operation, particularly at our training centers in Colorado Springs and Lake Placid. We are adapting, even more than we had imagined, to a new way of operating and we cannot predict how long it will take before we have clarity on what the future holds. \n\nThis reality, coupled with the economic challenges that are impacting our revenue, have led us to identify several areas where we will reduce our planned investments over the remainder of this year and throughout the next quadrennial. \n\nNext Tuesday morning we will review these planned changes in more detail during a virtual Town Hall. For today, our focus will remain on our team members. \n\nMany of you have already discussed the changes that will occur within your team with your managers. If you have not, you will have the opportunity to do so soon. For some, there will be a lot of change and for others, there will be little or no change at all. But all of us will need to adapt to a smaller team, new accountabilities, and a different structure. That process will take some time and a good bit of patience. \n\nAt the end of a difficult day, and a tough month, we must all be asking ourselves if something that feels so awful is necessary and right. \n\nI believe that these actions are the right ones. All of this\u00a0will\u00a0make the difference. Because it isn\u2019t one thing that will determine our success. It is the right combination of mission, values, strategic focus, discipline, talent, and fiscal responsibility and efficiency that will define our success. These actions will: \n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sustain the resources required for Team USA athletes to achieve competitive success \n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Support Team USA athletes in new ways off the field of play through health and wellness, engagement, and a deeper commitment to safety than ever before \n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Deliver an exceptional experience for the Team USA Delegation at three Games over a four-year timeframe \n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Invest in the strength and compliance of our partner NGBs so that they too can support Team USA athletes better than ever \n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Integrate our teams in innovative ways to optimize the impact of our voice and those of Team USA athletes as we, collectively, inspire our country \n\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reward our talented team members for delivering results and living by our values \n\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lay the foundation for a strong organization not only in the next quad, but the one after that in which we welcome the world to our home. \n\nWe owe it to Team USA and all our supporters. Today and for years to come. \n\nI look forward to being with all of you on Tuesday. \n\nSarah \n\n\u00a0 \n  \n\t\t\t"}}
