Reports of coyotes, in particular, have been spotted in once-popular streets of San Francisco to Chicago and beyond.\nBut as restrictions loosen up and more people are going outside, what will happen when the wildlife starts to mix with human\u2019s return?\n\u201cThere\u2019s not any more of the critters, but they are changing their behaviors,\u201d said Eric Strauss, president\u2019s professor of biology for Loyola Marymount University\u2019s Center for Urban Resilience. \u201cThe wildlife in urban areas are always adjusting their behavior based on ours.\u201d\nUrban wildlife, like coyotes, have become dependent on humans for food, finding scraps on the streets in the darkness or early morning hours, while most people sleep.\nDuring the coronavirus shutdown, \u201cthe abundant food resource got shut off in a matter of days. It changed the foraging dynamics, the risk analysis of what they should take in respect to searching for food,\u201d Strauss said.\nAs people stayed indoors, our \u201ccenter spots\u201d were less used, allowing wildlife to expand their radius.\n\u201cIn almost every city, you\u2019re reading some story about them walking in some area that had been historically dominated by humans,\u201d Strauss said. \u201cThere\u2019s no people, and there\u2019s not as much food, so they are taking longer to search for food.\n\u201cAs we withdraw, more habitat becomes available for them to search for food,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they are showing up, there\u2019s no people and no food. It takes longer to check out before they give up and go somewhere else.\u201d\nPlus, people are at home looking out of their windows when they would otherwise be in offices focused instead on work and other distractions, Strauss noted.\nWhat we\u2019re seeing during the coronavirus pandemic is \u201chabitat fragmentation.\u201d\n\u201cWhen we back off a bit, we see them move into the new areas,\u201d he said.\nWhen we move back outside, they will likely move away.\n\u201cSome coyotes are getting bolder,\u201d he said.\nIn Laguna Beach recently, authorities have been on the hunt for a coyote that bit a 91-year-old man who was picking up his newspaper in the driveway. Authorities \nRelocating a problem coyote is not an option because it only moves the problem to another neighborhood, California Department of Fish and Wildlife authorities say.\nStrauss and his students are working on a project that uses about 30 remote cameras set around Culver City, recording when movement, whether it be human or wildlife, is sensed. Thousands of photos are being generated a week, showing the exact time and place creatures are detected without interfering with their behavior.\n\u201cWhat is their temporal use of land before the pandemic, through it and after?\u201d Strauss wonders. \u201cIt will be very interesting to see.\n\u201cI think what we are going to see we can tie into exact human events.\u201d\nThe Huntington Beach coyote seemed to just be out for a stroll, as it trotted across Main Street and Olive Avenue, chasing a squirrel under a car, Daniel said.\n\u201cHe went around to the other side,\u201d Daniel said, \u201cand the squirrel got up a tree before the coyote could get breakfast.\u201d"},"3":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tSanta Clarita substitute teacher suspected of lewd acts with student arrested\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/05\/28\/santa-clarita-substitute-teacher-suspected-of-lewd-acts-with-student-arrested\/","img":"https:\/\/images.pexels.com\/photos\/518543\/pexels-photo-518543.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940","discription":"\nAuthorities arrested a Saugus High School substitute teacher suspected of having a sexual relationship with a female student, officials said Thursday, May 28.\nDavid Cornish, 28, was taken into custody Wednesday at his residence in the Santa Clarita, Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department officials said in a news release.

In addition, they argued, pocket listings allow discrimination against racial and ethnic minorities or are used by sellers\u2019 agents to cut buyer agents out of a deal, hogging the whole commission.\nBoth the Top Agent Network and PLS.com have private databases agents can use to search for buyers or properties for sale. But unlike the MLS\u2019s, those posts aren\u2019t publicly available outside the network.\nPrivate marketing allows celebrities and the wealthy to maintain privacy while selling luxury homes or allow clients to test the market without the stigma of listing and then delisting a property in the MLS, advocates say.\n\u201cDemand for pocket listing services has skyrocketed in recent years, particularly in large and competitive real estate markets such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, and Washington, D.C.,\u201d the PLS.com lawsuit says. \u201cIn some of these markets, 20 percent or more of residential real estate was being sold outside the NAR-affiliated MLS system, primarily as pocket listings.\u201d\nThe California Regional MLS has more than 100,000 members, covering all of Orange County and portions of Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties. It also serves communities in Central and Northern California, going as far north as Red Bluff, located between Chico and Redding.\nAgents violating the pocket listing policy in the California Regional MLS territory face fines of 1% of the home\u2019s purchase price up to a maximum of $2,500. Violations in San Francisco can fetch fines of $5,000 for the first violation, the Top Agent Network lawsuit said.\nThe PLS.com suit seeks an injunction against the pocket listing ban and unspecified monetary damages."},"8":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\t186 new coronavirus cases and 8 deaths in the San Fernando Valley in 24 hours\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/05\/28\/186-new-coronavirus-cases-and-8-deaths-in-the-san-fernando-valley-in-24-hours\/","img":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/LDN-L-BOB-RESTAURANT-0528-DC-1-1.jpg?w=525","discription":"\nAs of Tuesday May 26, 2020, there were 8,730 documented cases of the novel coronavirus in San Fernando Valley communities, according to the \nThere have been 412 total COVID-19 deaths recorded in the core areas of the San Fernando Valley, where 87,155 people have been tested for the virus.\nBetween 8 p.m. Monday and Tuesday, there were 186 new cases and 8 deaths in San Fernando Valley communities.\nThe Valley communities with the most overall cases of COVID-19 are Sylmar with 749, Panorama City with 693, and Pacoima and Van Nuys with 664 each.\n \nOutside of the San Fernando Valley, the Agoura and Calabasas area has a total of 100 cases and 7 deaths.\nThe Burbank-Glendale area, including La Canada Flintridge, has 1,424 cases and 122 deaths.\nThe Santa Clarita and Antelope Valley areas, including Canyon Country and Castaic, have 2,525 cases and 57 deaths.\nThere could be more cases in any of these areas.

It calls for the construction of an urban district with nearly 1,400 residential units, 280,000 square feet of shops and restaurants, 731,500 square feet of office space and 572 hotel rooms.\nDuring a virtual meeting hosted by the City Planning Commission hearing on the Promenade 2035 mega-development, hundreds of participants dialed in to wave on the controversial development.\nThe hearing comes months after city planners recommended a fully enclosed 7,500-seat arena as part of the massive development proposed for Woodland Hills that was half the capacity of the originally proposed 15,000-seat stadium. The proposal triggered several appeals regarding the lack of affordable housing, the size of the stadium and air quality.\nDevelopers said the project represents over $1 billion in long-term investment in Warner Center, creating more than 10,800 construction jobs and over 9,700 permanent jobs upon completion.\nUnibail-Rodamco-Westfield agreed to modify their proposal, offering a smaller sports and entertainment center along with rent-restricted affordable housing.\nThe stadium, the developer said, will be a catalyst for economic growth, attracting further investment in the Warner Center area. It will include a dedicated space for cultural programming and also provide a gathering place for community events such as high school and college graduations and various cultural events.\n\u201cWe\u2019re tired of transporting over the hill\u201d to see events,\u201d said Larry Green, executive vice president-development at Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield.\nIn response to community feedback, the developer agreed to redesign the venue, reducing its square footage from 320,000 square feet to 181,550 square feet and its height from 155 feet to approximately 85 feet. The venue will be encircled with landscaping, trees, open space and pedestrian paths.\nBut opponents fear the venue will attract rowdy crowds and fill up the 101 Freeway with cars.\nWest Hills resident Christine Rowe said she was \u201cabsolutely\u201d opposed to the stadium.\n\u201cI\u2019m disgusted with the new arena,\u201d she said.\nSupporters said they approved the 10,000-people facility, smaller than downtown\u2019s Staples Center, that they hope will bring construction jobs and attract entertainment events in years ahead.\nThe updated plan includes a commitment for a total of 15% of the project\u2019s initial residential units to be affordable, workforce and stakeholder housing divided into:\nGina K. Thornburg, executive director of Coalition for Valley Neighborhoods criticized the plan for not proposing to build more affordable units, demanding that the developer build 7.5% of the 1,009 units, to be preserved in perpetuity for the very low-Income residents.\nWoodland Hills Homeowners Organization president John Walker said his office supported the modified project.\n\u201cWe\u2019re encouraged that they\u2019re making some major modifications that increase the benefits to the community and mitigating the negative impacts on them, especially with the downsize of the arena,\u201d Walker said."},"10":{"tilte":"\n\t\t\tSword-wielding suspect fatally shot by police in North Hollywood\t\t","link":"https:\/\/www.dailynews.com\/2020\/05\/27\/sword-wielding-suspect-fatally-shot-by-police-in-north-hollywood-authorities-say\/","img":"https:\/\/images.pexels.com\/photos\/518543\/pexels-photo-518543.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940","discription":"\nPolice fatally shot a person involved in a dispute with a neighbor and armed with a bladed weapon in North Hollywood on Wednesday, May 27, authorities said.\nOfficers were dispatched to reports of a \u201cneighbor dispute\u201d on the 6400 block of Elmer Ave., said Officer Tony Im, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department.
